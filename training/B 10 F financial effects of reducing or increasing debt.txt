B.10F. Financial effects of reducing or increasing debt on clients probability of success in long and short termReducing or increasing debt can have significant financial effects on a client's probability of success in achieving their short and long term goals. Here are some examples:1. Short term goals: Short term goals typically have a time frame of one year or less, and may include things like paying off debt, building an emergency fund, or saving for a vacation. Reducing debt can have a positive impact on short term goals, as it frees up money to put towards other expenses. For example, if a client reduces their credit card debt, they may be able to allocate more money towards building an emergency fund or saving for a vacation. On the other hand, increasing debt can have a negative impact on short term goals, as it can limit the amount of money available for other expenses.2. Long term goals: Long term goals typically have a time frame of five years or more, and may include things like saving for retirement, buying a home, or paying for a child's education. Reducing debt can have a positive impact on long term goals, as it can free up money to put towards savings and investments. For example, if a client reduces their student loan debt, they may be able to allocate more money towards saving for retirement or a down payment on a home. On the other hand, increasing debt can have a negative impact on long term goals, as it can limit the amount of money available for savings and investments.
