B.12A. Calculate the present value and future value of annuities and single amounts, uneven and serial paymentsAnnuity of $500,000. The present value of an annuity can be calculated using the formula: PV = (PMT/r) * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)), where PV is the present value, PMT is the payment amount, r is the interest rate per period and n is the number of periods.In this case, with a payment amount of 500,000, an interest rate of 6% per period and 20 periods, the present value would be: PV = (500000/0.06) * (1 - (1 + 0.06)^(-20)) = 5,637,408.54.So the present value of your annuity would be approximately 5,637,408.54.The future value of an annuity can be calculated using the formula: FV = (PMT/r) * ((1 + r)^n - 1), where FV is the future value, PMT is the payment amount, r is the interest rate per period and n is the number of periods.In your case, with a payment amount of 500,000, an interest rate of 6% per period and 20 periods, the future value would be: FV = (500000/0.06) * ((1 + 0.06)^20 - 1) = 15,762,100.00.So the future value of your annuity would be approximately 15,762,100.00.Annuity payment example:Harold, age 64, purchased an annuity 24 years ago for $500,000. This year he began receiving payments of $3,500 per month, which will continue for the rest of his life. Assume that Don’s life expectancy is 17 years, and he is in the 28% tax bracket. Step 1: Total payments expected =$3,500 per month *12 months * 17 years = $714,000 Step 2: Exclusion ratio =$500,000 / $714,000 =0.7002 =70.02% Step 1: Total payments expected =$3,500 per month *12 months *17 years = $714,000 Step 2: Exclusion ratio = $500,000 / $714,000 = 0.7002Step 3: Tax-free portion =$3,500 = 0.7002 =$2,450This is because Harold’s basis is 500,000, and he can’t be double taxed on his initial basis on the annuity. Only on the gains/amount after.
