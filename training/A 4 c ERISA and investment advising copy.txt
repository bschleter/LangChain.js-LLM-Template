A.4C. Investment advisor regulation and financial planning aspects of ERISAERISA, which stands for the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, is a federal law that sets standards for the management and operation of private sector employee benefit plans, including pension plans and 401(k) plans. ERISA also sets guidelines for the conduct of investment advisors and financial planners who provide services to these plans.Here are some of the investment advisor regulations and financial planning aspects of ERISA:1. Fiduciary standards: ERISA imposes strict fiduciary standards on investment advisors and financial planners who provide services to employee benefit plans. These standards require advisors to act in the best interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries, and to avoid any conflicts of interest that could compromise their ability to provide impartial advice.2. Prohibited transactions: ERISA prohibits certain transactions between employee benefit plans and parties that have a relationship with the plan, including investment advisors and financial planners. These transactions are known as prohibited transactions and include any transaction that involves self-dealing, conflicts of interest, or transactions that benefit the advisor or planner at the expense of the plan.3. Reporting and disclosure requirements: ERISA requires employee benefit plans to provide regular reports and disclosures to plan participants and beneficiaries, including information about plan fees, expenses, and investment performance. Investment advisors and financial planners who provide services to these plans are also required to disclose any conflicts of interest or other relevant information that could impact their ability to provide impartial advice.4. Plan design and administration: ERISA sets guidelines for the design and administration of employee benefit plans, including rules related to eligibility, vesting, and distribution of plan assets. Investment advisors and financial planners who provide services to these plans must be familiar with these rules and ensure that their advice is consistent with the plan's objectives and parameters.5. Enforcement: ERISA is enforced by the Department of Labor (DOL), which has the authority to investigate complaints and take enforcement action against investment advisors and financial planners who violate ERISA's fiduciary standards or engage in prohibited transactions.* Investment advisors to ERISA plans have a fiduciary duty, meaning they must act in the best interests of plan participants and beneficiaries. They must manage the plans prudently and diversify investments.* There are various disclosure and reporting requirements for ERISA plans. Plan fiduciaries must disclose information such as fees, expenses, and investment options to participants. They must also file reports with the government.* ERISA limits certain transactions between plans and parties-in-interest, such as plan fiduciaries and service providers. These are meant to prevent conflicts of interest and abuse. Certain exemptions may apply if disclosures are made and fair market value is paid.* ERISA plans must be managed according to a prudent expert standard, considering factors like risk and return objectives, as well as plan costs. An investment policy statement can help lay out the process and governance for managing plan investments.* Financial advisors to individuals must be aware of any ERISA implications for retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs they manage. They cannot give advice that would constitute a prohibited transaction. They must also consider any fiduciary responsibilities they may have, especially if providing investment management services.Some common examples of prohibited transactions for financial advisors under ERISA include:* Selling assets or investments to an ERISA plan from their own business. For example, an advisor cannot sell proprietary investment products or funds to a plan they advise.* Borrowing money or extending credit from an ERISA plan. For example, an advisor cannot borrow money from a client's retirement account.* Receiving compensation for advising an ERISA plan from a third party. For example, an advisor cannot accept commissions from a fund company for investing plan assets in their funds. Compensation must be reasonable and from the plan itself.* Acting as a fiduciary to an ERISA plan while also acting as a fiduciary for other parties whose interests conflict with the plan. For example, an advisor cannot advise a plan to invest in funds from which they also receive commissions. Their fiduciary duties must be to the plan participants.* Using plan assets for personal gain or benefit. For example, an advisor cannot invest plan assets in their own business or investments for their own profit. They must be managed for the exclusive benefit of participants.
