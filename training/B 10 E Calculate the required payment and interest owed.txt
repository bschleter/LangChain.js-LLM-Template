B.10E. Required payment, interest owed or saved and a new payment term in making a debt prioritization planExample prioritization plan:	Income 78,000/year.  Rent: 1,800/month, 1. Pay more than the minimum on the credit card: While making the minimum payment of $250 on the credit card is important, it's also important to pay more than the minimum to reduce the balance faster and save money on interest charges. Aim to pay at least $300 per month on the credit card.2. Pay off the personal loan faster as higher interest rate, it's important to pay it off as quickly as possible. Make the minimum payment of $100 per month, and consider making extra payments when possible to pay off the loan faster.3. Pay the student loan: Since the student loan has a higher interest rate than the car loan, it's important to prioritize it next. Make the income-based repayment amount each month, but consider making extra payments when possible to pay off the loan faster. This may depend on student loan forgiveness provisions. Income based repayment is $250. 4. Pay the car loan: Since the car loan has a lower interest rate than the other debts, it can be prioritized last. Make the monthly payments of $530 per month, but consider making extra payments when possible to pay off the loan faster.Here's a breakdown of the monthly payments: ~4,380/month in income. * Personal loan: $100* Credit card: $300* Student loan: Income-based repayment amount (varies)-250* Car loan: $530* Rent-1800* Expenses-900This adds to about 3,880 in monthly expenses. Depending on emergency savings and retirement savings, we will need to take the residual $500 here and put most of it towards the credit card to get it down over the next year and half. This then will add flexibility in monthly savings, and then we will work on personal loan as well. A good way to help and see is to get the expenses of 900 down an extra 20-30% if possible in this example.
