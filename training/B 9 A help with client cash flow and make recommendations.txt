Estimate all income and sources of income:Potential income Opportunities:* See if client has income sources such as bonuses, rental income, or freelance work can increase a client's cash inflows and provide opportunities for saving and investing.* If a client has a stable and consistent income, they can plan and budget more effectively.Challenges:* Irregular income sources can make it difficult to plan and budget effectively, leading to challenges in meeting current needs and long-term goals.* If a client's income is limited or unstable, it may be difficult to save or invest for the future.Recommendations:* Encourage clients to establish an emergency fund to help them manage unexpected expenses or changes in income.* Work with clients to develop a budget that takes into account their income sources and helps them prioritize their expenses based on their needs and goals.2.

Establish an emergency fund: An emergency fund can provide a buffer against unexpected expenses or changes in income. Encourage clients to save at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in their emergency fund. Sometimes this is easier said than done. Encourage to save this emergency fund over the next year. The biggest thing to tell people is that while you may have a budget, there are always things that pop up some months that you didn’t budget for. This may be a blown rod in your engine, this may be new tires, or medical bill. Either way, life always happens and doesn’t wait for you to budget some savings on the side. Many get discouraged by not being able to save a few hundred or thousand a month, so they just don’t do it. I encourage to start small, even if it is 100-200/month to eventually build the savings up. Once the savings is built up, you can reward yourself a little bit with a discretionary expense or goal. 2. Create a flexible budget: A flexible budget can help clients track their income and expenses and adjust their spending as necessary. Encourage clients to prioritize their needs vs. wants, and to allocate funds towards their most important financial goals. Like stated earlier, you need to be flexible a few hundred dollars at least each month to prepare for those unexpected costs. If for example you don’t have friends who are mechanics or plumbers who can do the job for free, then you need to plan for certain unexpected costs to pop up. 3. Use a cash flow management tool: A cash flow management tool such as a spreadsheet or budgeting app can help clients track their income and expenses and plan for the future. There are plenty, such as You Need a Budget, mint, and many others now that generative AI is here. These tools can help you identify areas where they can reduce expenses or increase income.4. Plan for irregular income: Encourage clients to plan for irregular income by setting aside a portion of their income for taxes and other expenses. This can help them avoid surprises at tax time and ensure that they have enough cash flow to cover their expenses throughout the year.5. Consider alternative income sources: If a client has irregular income, they may want to consider alternative income sources such as freelance work or a side business. These income sources can provide additional cash flow and help the client achieve their financial goals more quickly.6. Review the budget regularly: Encourage clients to review their budget regularly and make adjustments as necessary. This can help them stay on track with their financial goals and adjust their spending as their income changes. While you may have a budget, chances are you might not be sticking to it every month. When I see regular or high withdraws, I have to show client’s on a year after year basis exactly how much they spent, and sometimes they spend almost double their income!
