B.12B. NPV and the IRR of investments and how to apply to financial planning process NPV (Net Present Value) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) are two common methods used to evaluate the profitability of an investment.The formula for calculating NPV is: NPV = ∑(Cash inflow / (1 + discount rate)^period) - initial investmentHere’s an example scenario: Let’s say you’re considering investing $1000 in a project that will generate cash inflows of $500 in year 1, $400 in year 2 and $300 in year 3. The discount rate is 10%. The NPV would be calculated as follows:NPV = ($500 / (1 + 0.10)^1) + ($400 / (1 + 0.10)^2) + ($300 / (1 + 0.10)^3) - $1000 NPV = $413.22The formula for calculating IRR is more complex and requires trial and error or the use of a financial calculator or spreadsheet software. The IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero.Using the same example scenario as above, we can find the IRR by solving for the discount rate in the NPV formula:0 = ($500 / (1 + IRR)^1) + ($400 / (1 + IRR)^2) + ($300 / (1 + IRR)^3) - $1000Solving this equation gives us an IRR of approximately 19%.The formula for IRR (Internal Rate of Return) is more complex than that for NPV (Net Present Value) and there isn’t a straightforward formula like there is for NPV. Instead, IRR is calculated using an iterative numerical method. The goal is to find the discount rate that makes the NPV of the cash flows equal to zero.In other words, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of the future cash inflows from an investment equals the initial cost of the investment. It can be found by solving for the discount rate in the NPV formula:0 = ∑(Cash inflow / (1 + IRR)^period) - initial investmentThis equation can be solved using trial and error or with a financial calculator or spreadsheet software.Here’s an example of how to calculate IRR using a financial calculator:1. Enter the initial investment as a negative value. For example, if the initial investment is $1000, enter -1000.2. Enter the cash inflows for each period. For example, if the cash inflow in year 1 is $500, enter 500.3. Press the IRR button on the calculator and it will display the IRR as a percentage.Keep in mind that different financial calculators may have slightly different steps for calculating IRR.You are considering an investment in a project that will cost $50,000 upfront and is expected to generate cash flows of $15,000 per year for 5 years. The discount rate for the project is 10%. Here's how you can calculate the NPV and IRR:To calculate the NPV, you need to discount each of the cash flows to present value and add them up. Using the formula:NPV = CF1 / (1+r)^1 + CF2 / (1+r)^2 + ... + CFn / (1+r)^n - Initial Investmentwhere CF1 to CFn are the cash flows for each year, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of years.In this case, the cash flows are $15,000 per year for 5 years, so:NPV = $15,000 / (1+0.1)^1 + $15,000 / (1+0.1)^2 + $15,000 / (1+0.1)^3 + $15,000 / (1+0.1)^4 + $15,000 / (1+0.1)^5 - $50,000NPV = $15,000 / 1.1 + $15,000 / (1.1)^2 + $15,000 / (1.1)^3 + $15,000 / (1.1)^4 + $15,000 / (1.1)^5 - $50,000NPV = $13,636.36 + $12,378.23 + $11,252.02 + $10,243.66 + $9,339.69 - $50,000NPV = -$3,140.04The NPV of the investment is negative, which means that the investment is not expected to generate enough return to cover the initial investment and the cost of capital.To calculate the IRR, you need to find the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero. You can use a financial calculator or Excel to do this. In this case, the IRR is approximately 6.7%.Another example:An investment of $100,000 is expected to generate cash flows of $25,000 per year for 5 years. The discount rate for this project is 8%. Here's how you can calculate the NPV and IRR:To calculate the NPV, you need to discount each of the cash flows to present value and add them up. Using the formula:NPV = CF1 / (1+r)^1 + CF2 / (1+r)^2 + ... + CFn / (1+r)^n - Initial Investmentwhere CF1 to CFn are the cash flows for each year, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of years.In this case, the cash flows are $25,000 per year for 5 years, so:NPV = $25,000 / (1+0.08)^1 + $25,000 / (1+0.08)^2 + $25,000 / (1+0.08)^3 + $25,000 / (1+0.08)^4 + $25,000 / (1+0.08)^5 - $100,000NPV = $25,000 / 1.08 + $25,000 / (1.08)^2 + $25,000 / (1.08)^3 + $25,000 / (1.08)^4 + $25,000 / (1.08)^5 - $100,000NPV = $23,148.15 + $21,394.98 + $19,777.14 + $18,284.17 + $16,906.18 - $100,000NPV = $99,510.62Therefore, the NPV of the investment is positive, which means that the investment is expected to generate a return that is greater than the cost of capital.To calculate the IRR, you need to find the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero. You can use a financial calculator or Excel to do this. In this case, the IRR is approximately 14.5%.The investment has an IRR of 14.5%, which is greater than the cost of capital, indicating that the project is a good investment.
