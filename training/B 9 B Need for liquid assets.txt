B.9B. Communicate need for liquid assets and emergency funds and recommend strategies for accumulating those fundsCommunicating the need for liquid assets and emergency funds to clients is an important part of the financial planning process. Here are some tips for communicating the importance of liquid assets and emergency funds, as well as recommendations for strategies to accumulate those funds:1. Explain the importance of liquid assets and emergency funds: Explain why it's important to have liquid assets and emergency funds. Provide examples of unexpected expenses or changes in income that could impact their financial well-being, and explain how having liquid assets and emergency funds can help mitigate these risks. By not having liquid assets as an initial protection to your financial lifestyle, you put yourself at further putting yourself in a financial hole that can take years off a retirement projection, force you to work more years before retirement, and put you further in debt. Such things as your credit score will take a hit, which believe it or not, will cost you thousands over your lifetime if you have a low score.  2. Assess the client's current financial situation: Before recommending specific strategies for accumulating liquid assets and emergency funds, assess the client's current financial situation. This may include reviewing their income, expenses, debt, and assets. While they may have debt, building an emergency fund is still important. However, slowly building an emergency fund over time may be of higher importance as they pay down their high amounts of debt. The key is to balance savings and debt paydown to ensure that they don’t have another emergency pop up that puts them into further debt. 3. Determine the appropriate amount of liquid assets and emergency funds: Based on the client's financial situation and goals, determine how much they need to set aside in liquid assets and emergency funds. The general rule of thumb is to have three to six months' worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Another initial rule of thumb that is good, is to ensure that you have at least your health insurance deductible in emergency savings or HSA/FSA. Three to six months of living expenses is generally better, but sometimes a hard goal to imagine for many people psychologically, so people simply don’t do it.  4. Recommend strategies for accumulating liquid assets and emergency funds: Once you have determined the appropriate amount of liquid assets and emergency funds, recommend strategies for accumulating those funds. Here are some examples:* Automate savings: Encourage clients to set up automatic transfers from their checking account to a savings account or emergency fund. This can help them save consistently and avoid the temptation to spend the money.* Prioritize savings: Encourage clients to prioritize savings and make it a part of their budget. This may mean cutting back on discretionary expenses or finding ways to increase their income.* Consider high-yield savings accounts: High-yield savings accounts offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts, which can help clients earn more on their savings.* Consider low-risk investments: If a client has a longer time horizon, they may want to consider low-risk investments such as money market funds or short-term bonds. These investments can provide a higher return than traditional savings accounts, while still maintaining a low level of risk.
