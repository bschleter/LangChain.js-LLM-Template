B.13A. Calculate dollar amount needed to meet education goals Future Cost = Present Cost x (1 + Inflation Rate)^Number of YearsUsing the information provided, the present cost of college per year is $30,000 for tuition, $1,500 for books, and $4,000 for room and board, for a total of $35,500 per year.Assuming an inflation rate of 2%, we can calculate the future cost of college for 12 years from now as follows:Future Cost = $35,500 x (1 + 0.02)^12Future Cost = $35,500 x 1.26824Future Cost = $45,062.20Therefore, to fund four years of college with tuition, books, and room and board adjusted for 2% inflation, you would need to save approximately $180,248.80. This assumes that the cost of college will continue to increase at an annual rate of 2% over the next 12 years.However, college costs in the past decade and half have increased more than the annual rate of inflation, typically around 5-6% to be realistic. Assuming those figures in the above scenario, the costs would be around: $285,443.80. Here you can see how annually college costs rising quicker than typical inflation makes the idea scenario of college funding much harder and expensive.
