B.9C. Calculate savings required to meet financial goals and recommend how to incorporate savings into cash flow planHere are the steps to calculate the savings required and implement them into a cash flow plan:1. Identify the financial goal: Example: Client wants to save $50,000 for a down payment on a house in five years.2. Determine the cost of the financial goal: Based on the client's desired down payment amount, they will need to save an average of $10,000 per year for the next five years.3. Calculate the savings required: Assuming an average annual compound of 2% in savings, over 5 years, a client would need to save $800/month to accumulate 50,000 in 5 years. 4. Incorporate savings into the cash flow plan: To implement the savings required into the cash flow plan, the client will need to adjust their budget to accommodate the monthly savings amount. For example, they may need to reduce discretionary expenses such as dining out or entertainment, or find ways to increase their income, such as taking on a side job or negotiating a raise. This is rather simplistic on the surface, but harder to dig down and do. The easiest way is to look at grocery shopping expenses, particularly if it’s a family or they have high amount in the food budget. 5. Monitor progress and adjust as necessary: It's important to monitor the client's progress towards their savings goal and make adjustments as necessary. This may involve revisiting the savings required calculation if the client's financial situation changes, or adjusting the cash flow plan to accommodate changes in income or expenses.
