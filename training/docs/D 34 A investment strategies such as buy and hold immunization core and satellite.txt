D.34A.  Investment strategies such as buy-and-hold, immunization, core and satellite, passive (indexed) and active management techniques such as tactical allocation, market timing, Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) investing, sector rotation. Buy-and-hold strategy: This is a long-term investment strategy in which an investor buys stocks, bonds or other securities and holds them for an extended period, typically years or decades. The aim is to benefit from the long-term growth potential of the investment and avoid the short-term fluctuations in the market.Immunization strategy: This is a risk management technique that involves matching the duration of a portfolio of bonds or other fixed-income securities to the investor's desired investment horizon. The goal is to protect the portfolio from interest rate changes by ensuring that the cash flows from the bonds will match the expected future liabilities.Core and satellite strategy: This is a portfolio management technique that involves dividing a portfolio into two parts. The core part consists of low-cost, passively managed index funds that provide broad market exposure. The satellite part consists of actively managed funds that focus on specific sectors or themes.Passive (indexed) management: This is a strategy that seeks to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500, by investing in a portfolio of securities that closely matches the composition of the index. The goal is to achieve returns that are similar to the index while minimizing costs and management fees.Active management techniques:Tactical allocation: This is a strategy that involves shifting the asset allocation of a portfolio to take advantage of short-term market opportunities. The aim is to generate higher returns than a buy-and-hold strategy by making timely adjustments based on market trends.Market timing: This is a strategy that involves making investment decisions based on predictions of future market movements. The goal is to buy stocks when the market is expected to rise and sell them when it is predicted to fall.ESG investing: This is a strategy that involves considering environmental, social, and corporate governance factors when making investment decisions. The goal is to invest in companies that have a positive impact on society and the environment, while avoiding those that have negative impacts.Sector rotation: This is a strategy that involves shifting the portfolio's asset allocation to different sectors of the economy based on their expected performance. The goal is to benefit from the cyclical nature of the economy by investing in sectors that are expected to outperform in the near term.Here are the steps to implement a core and satellite strategy:1. Determine your investment goals: Before implementing a core and satellite strategy, you need to decide on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon. This will help you determine the appropriate asset allocation for your core and satellite portfolio, how much volatility your portfolio can withstand, and 2. Build your core portfolio: The core portfolio should consist of low-cost, passively managed index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide broad market exposure to establish basic beta. The most common index funds are those that track the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or the total US stock market. The core should make up the majority of your portfolio, typically 70-80%.3. Choose your satellite investments: The satellite investments are actively managed funds or positions that focus on specific sectors or themes that you believe have the potential to outperform the market. For example, you might choose a technology-focused fund, a healthcare fund or an international fund. The satellite funds should make up the remaining portion of your portfolio, typically 20-30%.4. Monitor and rebalance: Once you have established your core and satellite portfolio, it's important to monitor and periodically rebalance it to maintain the desired asset allocation. This means adjusting the portfolio to ensure that the core and satellite portions remain in the intended proportions, typically on an annual basis.5. Evaluate performance: Finally, it's important to evaluate the performance of your core and satellite portfolio over time. This will help you determine if your investment strategy is meeting your objectives and if any adjustments need to be made. You should also regularly review the performance of your satellite investments to ensure they are delivering the expected returns and still align with your investment goals.Immunization is an investment strategy that aims to "immunize" a portfolio against interest rate changes. It involves structuring a bond portfolio so that its duration matches the investor's time horizon.Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes. A portfolio with a duration that matches the investor's time horizon will minimally fluctuate in value if interest rates change, thereby immunizing it. This is because as interest rates change, the value of the existing bonds will decrease, but that will be offset by the increase in value of the new bonds purchased at the new interest rates.So immunization reduces interest rate risk for a fixed time horizon. It is commonly used by investors with fixed liabilities far in the future, like pension funds. The challenge is that as market interest rates change over time, the portfolio needs to be rebalanced to maintain the duration match. So it requires active monitoring and management of the bond holdings. example of an immunization strategy using 4 bonds with different durations:• 25% allocated to 2-year bonds with a duration of 2 years• 25% allocated to 5-year bonds with a duration of 5 years• 25% allocated to 10-year bonds with a duration of 10 years• 25% allocated to 15-year bonds with a duration of 15 yearsThis portfolio has a weighted average duration of around 8 years. So it would be immunized against interest rate changes for an investor with an 8-year time horizon. The allocations could be adjusted to achieve different target durations.1. Check the new duration of each bond based on the 1% interest rate change. The durations of the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year bonds would change to 1.02 years, 4.95 years, 9.90 years, and 14.85 years respectively.2. Calculate the weighted average duration of the portfolio based on the new bond durations. In this case, it would be around 8.03 years (1.02 + 4.95 + 9.90 + 14.85 = 30.72 / 4 = 7.68, rounded to 8.03).3. Compare the new weighted average duration to your target duration of around 8 years. In this case, the duration has increased slightly, so you would need to decrease the portfolio duration.4. Rebalance the portfolio allocations to decrease the duration. For example, you could decrease the allocations to the longer-duration 10-year and 15-year bonds, and increase the allocations to the shorter-duration 2-year and 5-year bonds. The specific changes would depend on your risk tolerance and outlook for further interest rate changes.5. Continue to monitor interest rates and rebalance the portfolio as needed to maintain the target duration.
