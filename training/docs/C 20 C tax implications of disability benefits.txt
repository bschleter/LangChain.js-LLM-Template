C.20C. Calculate the tax implications of paying for and receiving disability benefitsThe tax implications of receiving and paying for disability benefits can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the individual and the type of disability benefits in question. Here are some general guidelines:1. Taxation of disability income benefits: Generally, disability income benefits are taxable if they are paid by an employer and the premiums were paid with pre-tax dollars. If disability income benefits are paid with after-tax dollars through an individual purchased policy, they are paid to the individual tax-free. If disability income benefits are paid by an insurance policy that was purchased directly by the individual, the tax implications will depend on whether the premiums were paid with pre-tax or after-tax dollars.2. Tax implications of disability-related expenses: Individuals who incur expenses related to a disability may be eligible for tax deductions or credits. For example, expenses related to medical care, home modifications, and other disability-related expenses may be eligible for a tax deduction or credit if they exceed a certain threshold.
