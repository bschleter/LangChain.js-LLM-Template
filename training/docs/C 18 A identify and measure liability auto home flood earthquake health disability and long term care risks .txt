C.18A. Identify and measure liability, automobile, flood, earthquake, health, disability, long term care, and life risksIdentifying and measuring insurance risks can be a complex process that involves a variety of factors. Here are some general guidelines for identifying and measuring risks for common types of insurance:1. Liability Insurance: Liability insurance covers losses related to legal claims against a policyholder. To identify and measure liability risks, insurers typically look at factors such as the policyholder's occupation, the nature of their business, the types of products or services they offer, and their history of past claims.2. Automobile Insurance: Automobile insurance covers losses related to accidents or other incidents involving a policyholder's vehicle. To identify and measure automobile risks, insurers typically look at factors such as the policyholder's driving record, the make and model of their vehicle, the location where the vehicle is primarily driven, and the amount of coverage desired.3. Flood Insurance: Flood insurance covers losses related to flooding caused by natural disasters or other events. To identify and measure flood risks, insurers typically look at factors such as the location of the property, the elevation of the property relative to nearby water sources, and the history of flooding in the area.4. Earthquake Insurance: Earthquake insurance covers losses related to earthquakes and other seismic events. To identify and measure earthquake risks, insurers typically look at factors such as the location of the property, the likelihood of earthquakes in the area, and the structural integrity of the property.5. Health Insurance: Health insurance covers losses related to medical expenses and other healthcare costs. To identify and measure health risks, insurers typically look at factors such as the policyholder's age, health status, and medical history, as well as the level of coverage desired.6. Disability Insurance: Disability insurance covers losses related to the policyholder's inability to work due to a disability or illness. To identify and measure disability risks, insurers typically look at factors such as the policyholder's occupation, the nature of their work, and their history of past claims. Disability insurance typically covers up to 60% of the person’s income. A key consideration however is if a person has disability insurance with their employer, it may not be portable, plus it will pay in pre-tax dollars where as a privately purchased disability policy would pay in post-tax dollars. The disadvantage of privately purchased disability being that the person has to obtain and pay for it themselves, and can be more expensive. An example of the differences: A. Someone earns $100,000/year and has disability with their employer. If they have long term disability insurance through their employer, it would pay 60% of their income pre-tax after the Elimination Period. This would equate to roughly $44,000/year. B. Someone earns $100,000/year and has privately owned disability insurance. If they have long term disability on their own, it would pay 60% post-tax. This would equate to roughly $60,000/year. 7. Long-Term Care Insurance: Long-term care insurance covers losses related to the policyholder's need for long-term care, such as nursing home care or in-home support services. To identify and measure long-term care risks, insurers typically look at factors such as the policyholder's age, health status, and family history. Long term care insurance is typically best for those in the middle asset range of retirement, those who would not qualify for Medicaid for care, but also those who do not have enough assets to cover potentially 5 or more years of $5,000/month or more in long term care. If assets cannot sustain a $300,000 or more drawdown post tax, long term care is a good risk management tool. 8. Life Insurance: Life insurance covers losses related to the policyholder's death. To identify and measure life insurance risks, insurers typically look at factors such as the policyholder's age, health status, occupation, income earning years, debt, assets, and lifestyle, as well as the amount of coverage desired.
