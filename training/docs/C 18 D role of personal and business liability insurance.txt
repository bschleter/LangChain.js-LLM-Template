C.18D. Role of personal and business liability insurance in comprehensive financial planning as well as umbrella insurance A personal umbrella policy (PUP) provides additional liability coverage above and beyond your existing liability policies like auto, home, and boat insurance. It interacts with these underlying liability policies in the following ways:* It covers liability costs that exceed the limits of your other policies. So if you have a large liability claim that surpasses the coverage limits of your auto or home policy, your PUP would kick in to cover the excess costs.* It requires you to have certain minimum limits on your underlying liability policies. You cannot just have a PUP - you need to also maintain auto, home, etc. liability policies with standard coverage limits, and your PUP will supplement these. For most insurance companies, this is 250,000 for individual liability, and 500,000 for group liability. Typically referred to as 250K/500K liability coverage. The Umbrella coverage would be on top of this minimum liability coverage. * Its premium is based on your coverage needs and the liability limits of your underlying policies. The higher the limits on your other liability policies and the more liability coverage you want in your PUP, the higher the PUP premium will be.* It provides broader coverage than your other liability policies. A PUP typically covers all types of personal liability, whereas your auto or home policy may be more narrowly focused on liability from those specific risks. So a PUP can fill gaps in coverage.* An example of where personal umbrella coverage would be needed would be a family with 4 million in assets, and income of over $500,000/year. They have a 17 year old driver that get’s into a collision and is at fault for the accident. The other driver and passenger in the other car involved have long term disabilities arising from the accident, keeping them from enjoying life and working. They become aware of the assets the family has, they sue the family, and are awarded $1,000,000 in damages each, for a total of $2,000,000 in damages. The family had a 5 million dollar umbrella policy. Without a personal umbrella policy, the family would have been liable however the umbrella policy covers legal fees during the proceedings and the damages without incurring loss to the families assets. Common coverage amounts for personal umbrella insurance (PUP) include:* $1 million in coverage. This is a typical minimum amount that provides substantial additional liability protection above standard home and auto policies.* $2 million to $5 million in coverage. This level of umbrella insurance is good for those with significant assets to protect or those engaging in higher-risk activities, such as even having children drivers. * $10 million or more in coverage. This very high amount of coverage is more suitable for individuals with substantial wealth or owners of businesses. It provides maximum protection but also comes at a higher premium cost.Some examples of higher-risk activities that may warrant more personal umbrella policy (PUP) coverage include:* Piloting aircraft (planes, helicopters, etc.)* Having younger drivers on the policy* Operating a boat or other marine vehicle* Engaging in extreme sports like rock climbing, skydiving, off-road racing, etc.* Hosting events or activities on your property that involve a large number of people* Renting out property to tenants* Serving on the board of directors of a company* Employing people (for a business)* Owning multiple properties or vehiclesThe average premium for a personal umbrella policy (PUP) with a higher coverage amount (e.g. $2M to $5M) can range from $300 to $1000 per year. The exact premium will depend on various factors, including:* Your coverage amount. The more coverage you get, the higher the premium.* Your liability risks. If you engage in higher-risk activities or have significant assets/liabilities, premiums will be higher.* The limits and premiums of your underlying liability policies (home, auto, etc.). Higher limits on your other policies may qualify you for a lower PUP premium.* Your personal characteristics. Factors like your age, location, claims history, and credit score can affect premiums.* The insurance company and coverage options. Premiums can vary between companies and will be higher for broader coverage and less exclusions.I’m not married, I have umbrella coverage on my new home where my partner lives with me in a home we both bought, but my partner has a separate auto policy with a different company, how would I get them to be covered under my umbrella policy? We would like to keep our finances separate.If your partner lives with you but has their own separate auto insurance policy, here are the steps to get them covered under your personal umbrella policy:1. Notify your umbrella insurance company that you want to add your partner as an insured driver under your policy. You will need to provide their details like name, date of birth, driving history, etc.2. Your umbrella company will likely require that your partner's vehicle be listed on your auto policy, rather than having a separate policy. So you will need to add their vehicle to your auto insurance policy and drop their separate policy. Your umbrella coverage will then extend to your combined auto policy and the vehicles/drivers on it.3. There may be an additional premium cost to add your partner and their vehicle to your policies. The umbrella and auto insurers will re-evaluate your coverage and rates once the information is updated with the additional driver and vehicle. But ultimately it may be more cost-effective to bundle the coverage rather than having separate policies.4. Once the updates are made, your partner and their vehicle will have liability coverage under your umbrella policy, in addition to the other coverages provided by your auto policy. This ensures you both have sufficient coverage, especially for higher liability amounts.If you and your partner want to keep your finances separate, then combining your insurance policies may not be necessary or ideal. An alternative could be:* Besides combining policies, there is only one recommend way you could, by looking into a "single-limit" umbrella policy that provides a combined liability limit for multiple insured parties/households. This allows the coverage amount to be shared between separate policies/people, while still keeping finances separate. Some insurers offer these single-limit umbrella policies, but they may come at a higher premium.The best course of action is to simply combine. The savings alone by bundling extra could help, and there could be ways to make each party whole in a documented way later on, especially if you both are likely high income and looking at an umbrella policy.
