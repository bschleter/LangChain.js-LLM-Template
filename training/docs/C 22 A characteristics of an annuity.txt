C.22A. Characteristics of an annuity including contribution and distribution optionsAn annuity is a financial product that provides a guaranteed stream of income for a specified period or for the rest of your life. Here are some common characteristics of annuities, including contribution and distribution options:1. Contributions: Annuities can be funded with either a single lump-sum payment or periodic contributions over time. These are sometimes funded with retirement or investment accounts. 2. Taxation: Annuities are tax-deferred, and taxation on distributions are on a last-in-first-out (LIFO) basis. 3. Investment options: Annuities can be either fixed or variable, allowing you to choose investment options that suit your investment goals and risk tolerance.4. Fees: Annuities can come with various fees, such as administrative fees, mortality and expense charges, and surrender charges.5. Distribution options: Annuities can be set up to provide a guaranteed income stream for a fixed period or for the rest of your life. You can also choose to receive a lump-sum payment or take partial withdrawals over time.6. Death benefits: Most annuities include a death benefit, providing a payout to your beneficiaries in the event of your death.The main difference between an immediate annuity and a deferred annuity is the timing of when you start receiving payments.An immediate annuity starts paying out income right away, usually within a year of purchasing the annuity. This means that you make a lump-sum payment to an insurance company, and in return, the insurance company starts making regular payments to you immediately. This type of annuity is often used by people who are already retired and want a guaranteed source of income immediately. A deferred annuity, on the other hand, delays the start of payments until a future date. You can make either a lump-sum payment or regular contributions to the annuity, and the money grows tax-deferred until you start taking payments. The taxes are on any gains above the principal amounts you placed in, unless an IRA in which the taxes would be based on withdraws and ordinary income.Deferred annuities can be either fixed or variable, with fixed annuities providing a guaranteed rate of return, while variable annuities allow you to invest in mutual funds or other investment options. Deferred annuities are often used by people who are still working and want to save for retirement.One key difference is the way the payments are calculated. With an immediate annuity, the payout is usually based on your age and life expectancy at the time you purchase the annuity, along with the amount of money you contribute. This means that if you purchase an immediate annuity at a young age, your payments will be lower than if you purchase one at an older age, since the insurance company expects to pay out over a longer period of time.With a deferred annuity, the payout is generally based on the amount of money you contribute and the performance of the underlying investments. This means that if you contribute more money or choose higher-performing investments, your payments will be higher when you start taking them.Another difference is the amount of flexibility you have with your money. With an immediate annuity, once you make the lump-sum payment, you generally cannot access that money again. With a deferred annuity, you can usually withdraw a portion of the money before you start taking payments, although there may be fees or penalties for doing so. Generally penalties decrease over time, and annuity becomes penalty free around the 7-10 year mark. Often, deferred annuities will have a penalty free withdraw amount that is allowed, and that increases over time as the annuity is held longer.
