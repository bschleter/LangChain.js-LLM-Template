C.19C. Alternatives to Health Insurance such as COBRA, Medicaid, and OthersThere are several health insurance alternatives outside of workplace coverage or the marketplace. Here are a few examples:1. Association health plans: Association health plans are group health plans that allow small businesses and self-employed individuals to band together to purchase health insurance coverage. These plans may offer lower costs and broader coverage options than individual plans. These are typically within an industry such as dentistry, or a railroad workers union. 2. Health sharing ministries: Health sharing ministries are organizations that facilitate the sharing of healthcare costs among members who share similar beliefs and values. These programs are not insurance and do not guarantee coverage, but may be a lower-cost alternative for some individuals. It is important to not overlook the benefits or coverage in light of the potential lower costs. These plans are not ACA eligible, so they have fewer regulations and limits to what they may cover vs. an ACA exchange or private plan. They also do not have out of pocket maximums typically. So these do present with some inherent risk of not having coverage, or if some expensive chronic condition or catastrophic happens, there aren’t limits of what you might have to spend. 3. COBRA Health Insurance: COBRA is a federal law that allows individuals to continue their employer-sponsored health insurance coverage for a limited time after leaving their job or experiencing a qualifying event such as a reduction in work hours. COBRA coverage typically lasts up to 18 months, although in some situations it can last up to 36 months. With COBRA coverage however, you will typically be paying a higher amount as you will be paying the ‘employee’ portion as well as the ‘employer’ portion of the premium. Work Insurance 4. Short-term health insurance: Short-term health insurance plans provide coverage for a limited period, typically up to 12 months. These plans may be a good option if you are between jobs or waiting for employer-sponsored coverage to begin.5. Government programs: Depending on your income and eligibility, you may be able to enroll in government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).6. Retiree health plans: If you have retiree health benefits from your former employer, you may be able to keep that coverage after retiring. Employer plans typically provide more comprehensive benefits than original Medicare. Check if retiree coverage is offered and your eligibility and costs to maintain that coverage. This is becoming more rare however in the last 10 years. It's important to carefully consider all of your options when it comes to acquiring health coverage, and to work with a financial advisor or healthcare professional who can help you assess your needs and find the right coverage for you.COBRA CoverageCOBRA coverage can provide several benefits for individuals who have lost their job or experienced a reduction in work hours. Here are a few of the key benefits:1. Continuation of employer-sponsored coverage: COBRA allows you to continue your employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, which can help ensure you have access to the same doctors and medical providers you had before.
