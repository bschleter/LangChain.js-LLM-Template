C.20A. Describe differences between short-term and long-term disability plansDisability insurance is a type of insurance that provides income replacement for individuals who are unable to work due to an illness or injury. This type of insurance can be especially important for individuals who rely on their income to support themselves and their families.Short-term disability insurance typically provides coverage for a period of up to 6 months, although the exact length of coverage may vary depending on the policy. This type of insurance generally provides a percentage of the individual's income, usually ranging from 50% to 100%.Long-term disability insurance, on the other hand, provides coverage for a longer period of time, often up to several years or even until retirement age. The exact length of coverage may vary depending on the policy, but it is typically designed to provide income replacement for a longer period of time than short-term disability insurance. This insurance typically covers about 60% of an individual’s income. With employer based long term disability, there is also sometimes a monthly limit for higher income earners. A typical example is an income limit of $12,000/month, or 60% of an individual’s income cannot be higher than $12,000/month, and if it is, then it would be less than 60% of individuals income coverage. In this example, an individual would have to be making more than $240,000/year. 	$240,000*0.6 (60% coverage)=$144,000 annually. 	$144,000/12 months= $12,000/month. Both short-term and long-term disability insurance policies may have an elimination period before benefits are paid out, and the amount of coverage provided may also depend on the individual's occupation, income, and other factors.Provisions:There are some provisions or amendments that should be considered or looked at when purchasing a private disability policy. Sometimes they have exclusions in the provisions which you need to be mindful of, and different companies may market the provisions with different titles. It’s best to consult with a experienced licensed insurance individual to compare polices.When purchasing a privately purchased disability insurance policy, there are a number of provisions that you should look for to ensure that you have comprehensive coverage or no unexpected gaps in coverage that you are missing. Here are some key policy provisions to consider:1. Non-cancelable or guaranteed renewable: A non-cancelable policy guarantees that your policy premiums will remain the same for the life of your policy, and cannot be canceled by the insurer as long as you continue to pay your premiums. A guaranteed renewable policy is similar, but allows the insurer to increase your premiums based on factors such as age or occupation class.a. A nice benefit for a new professional is a graded premium policy, that has lower premiums in the first few years of a professional’s career such as a dentist. This allows the newer professional to get adequate coverage initially when it may have been to expensive to get in the first place. However, when these policy premiums convert to regular premiums, they tend to be more expensive later on. 2. Own occupation: An own occupation provision defines disability as the inability to perform your own occupation, rather than any occupation. This is an important distinction for professionals who may be able to work in a different field, but cannot perform the specific duties of their own occupation.There are different variations of own occupation coverage that one should be mindful of and consider:* True own occupation: This is the most comprehensive form of "own occupation" coverage. With a true own occupation policy, you are disabled if you are unable to perform the duties of your own occupation, even if you are still able to work in a different field.Let’s say the insured is you, and you as a surgeon specializes in a certain type of procedure like cataract repairs. You have been practicing for many years and have developed a reputation as one of the top surgeons in your field. Unfortunately, you are diagnosed with a condition that makes it impossible for you to perform the complex surgical procedures that you are known for. With a "true own occupation" policy, you would still receive benefits even if you were able to work in a different capacity such as teaching, because you are unable to perform the duties of your own occupation. This would allow you to receive income replacement while you adjust to your new circumstances, or pursue a different career path if necessary. While the teaching medical students may not pay as well as your surgery profession did, you can still receive disability benefits to cover the income gap, and still earn an income without being excluded by your disability policy. Without "true own occupation" coverage, you may not be eligible for benefits if you are able to work in a different capacity, even if you are unable to perform the duties of your own occupation. "True own occupation" coverage can be particularly beneficial for professionals who have highly specialized skills or work in physically demanding jobs that may be difficult to perform with certain disabilities.* Modified own occupation: With a modified own occupation policy, you are considered to be disabled if you are unable to perform the duties of your own occupation and are not working in any other occupation. However, if you are able to work in a different field, you may not be considered disabled even if you are unable to perform the duties of your own occupation.* Transitional own occupation: A transitional own occupation policy provides own occupation coverage for a limited period of time, typically two to three years, after which the definition of disability may change to a more restrictive standard. This is less commonly seen. * Any occupation with own occupation rider: Some policies may provide coverage under an "any occupation" definition of disability, but offer an "own occupation" rider that allows you to receive benefits if you are unable to perform the duties of your own occupation. It’s very important to overview any exclusions in your policy in an own occupation rider. While "own occupation" coverage can provide comprehensive protection for professionals, there are certain exclusions that may apply to this type of coverage. Here are some common exclusions to be aware of:* Pre-existing conditions: Many policies exclude coverage for disabilities caused by pre-existing conditions. A pre-existing condition is a health condition that you had before you applied for the policy, or that was diagnosed during a waiting period before the policy went into effect. One condition that may exclude coverage is an auto immune disorder that may lead to issues down the road such as plaque psoriasis to rheumatoid arthritis. * Self-inflicted injuries: Disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries, such as suicide or attempted suicide, may be excluded from coverage.* Drug or alcohol-related disabilities: Disabilities caused by drug or alcohol abuse may be excluded from coverage.* Criminal activity: Disabilities caused by criminal activity may be excluded from coverage.* War or military service: Disabilities caused by war or military service may be excluded from coverage.* Intentional or fraudulent acts: Disabilities caused by intentional or fraudulent acts, such as faking an injury or illness, may be excluded from coverage.3. Residual or partial disability: A residual or partial disability provision provides benefits if you are able to work, but at a reduced level or reduced income due to a disability. This can be important for individuals who are able to work part-time or in a reduced capacity, but still experience a loss of income due to their disability. The amount of coverage provided by a residual disability rider can vary depending on the policy and the specific terms of the rider. In general, a residual disability rider is designed to provide benefits for a partial disability, meaning that you are still able to work, but you are unable to perform all of your job duties or are working at a reduced capacity.The amount of the benefit provided by the rider is typically calculated based on the percentage of your income that you have lost due to the partial disability. For example, if your disability causes you to lose 50% of your income, the rider may provide benefits to cover that lost income up to the policy's maximum benefit amount.Here are a few examples of when a residual disability rider could be beneficial:* A part-time employee: Let's say you are a part-time employee who works 20 hours a week. You are diagnosed with a condition that makes it impossible for you to work your full schedule, but you are able to work 10 hours a week. With a residual disability rider, you could receive benefits for the lost income from the 10 hours of work that you are unable to perform.* A commission-based salesperson: If you work in a commission-based job, your income may be variable from month to month. A residual disability rider could help cover the loss of income if you are unable to work at your full capacity due to a disability.* A freelancer or self-employed individual: If you are self-employed or work as a freelancer, your income may be more difficult to quantify than that of an employee. A residual disability rider can help ensure that you receive benefits for the loss of income due to a disability, even if your income fluctuates from month to month.4. Cost of living adjustment: A cost of living adjustment provision increases your benefit amount each year to keep pace with inflation. This can help ensure that your benefits keep up with the rising cost of living over time. There are pros and cons to this rider, and this is generally one of the areas that are cut to provide for lower premiums. The thought being disability isn’t as risky to retirement if happens later in life, thus having a lower benefit due to inflation over time isn’t as bad. Disability earlier in your career, your benefit isn’t as reduced with inflation because you are earlier on in your career. While the cost of living adjustment is needed in some situations, there are certain variations too that can allow someone to keep the benefit while also lower premiums:* Fixed percentage increase: With a fixed percentage increase rider, your benefit amount increases each year by a fixed percentage, regardless of changes in the cost of living. For example, your benefit amount might increase by 3% each year. This option is generally the lesser expensive of the cost of living benefits, but over time as inflation compounds, it may not be able to keep up as much. Options that increase the cost of living over 3%, such as 5% may be too much an unnecessarily increase the cost of the policy. * Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase: With a CPI increase rider, your benefit amount increases each year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation. The exact increase will depend on the CPI for the relevant time period. This may be a good option to balance costs/benefits. * Guaranteed purchase option: With a guaranteed purchase option rider, you have the ability to increase your benefit amount at certain intervals, such as every three years. This allows you to increase your coverage as your income and expenses grow, and may include a cost of living adjustment. This is a common choice, as generally a professionals income increases over time, most often in their 30’s to early 50’s then generally income plateaus after 50’s. However this isn’t an inflation rider per se. * Indexed benefit: An indexed benefit rider provides a benefit amount that is adjusted for inflation based on a specific index, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Medical Consumer Price Index (MCPI). This can help ensure that your benefits keep pace with the rising cost of living over time.5. Rehabilitation benefits: Rehabilitation benefits can help cover the cost of vocational training or other services that can help you return to work after a disability. Disability only covers your income, and with a number of disabilities there is an increased cost of living that occurs. It’s important to weigh your risks of acquiring certain conditions that may increase the cost of living by your medical and family history, occupation, even genetics. 6. Waiver of premium: A waiver of premium provision allows you to stop paying premiums if you become disabled and are receiving benefits from your policy. This is something that gets forgotten by disability policy holders, and many don’t realize that they would have to pay premiums even if disabled. 7. Mental and nervous disorder coverage: Some policies may exclude coverage for mental and nervous disorders, or limit coverage for such conditions. It's important to consider any such limitations when selecting a policy.Mental and nervous disorder coverage is a type of coverage that provides benefits for disabilities caused by mental or emotional conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. This is increasingly becoming an important benefit especially for those in the medical field that experience higher rates of burnout. However, many disability insurance policies have exclusions or limitations on coverage for mental and nervous disorder claims. Here are some common exclusions you may encounter:* Limited coverage: Some policies may limit the amount of coverage provided for mental and nervous disorder claims. For example, a policy may provide coverage for a maximum of 24 months for mental and nervous disorders. This is an extremely important factor to look at when considering for a high stakes job where burnout is high or a mental disorder may exclude you from working such as a surgeon with schizophrenia. * Exclusion for certain conditions: Some policies may exclude coverage for certain mental or emotional conditions, such as substance abuse or personality disorders. Some policies do cover this, and having a disability insurance backdrop could encourage a policyholder to seek rehab help if they knew they had the income to cover them while they seeked help. * Requirement for hospitalization: Some policies may require that a policyholder be hospitalized in order to receive benefits for a mental or nervous disorder claim.* Pre-existing conditions: Disabilities caused by pre-existing mental or emotional conditions, or conditions that were diagnosed or treated within a certain time frame before the policy went into effect, may be excluded from coverage.* Self-inflicted injuries: Disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries, such as suicide or attempted suicide, may be excluded from coverage.Some policies may limit or not have mental/nervous disability coverage so it is important to look at including your group employer disability insurance.
