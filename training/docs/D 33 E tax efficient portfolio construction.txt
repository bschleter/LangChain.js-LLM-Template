D.33E Tax efficient portfolio meeting client objectivesThe construction and percentages of a portfolio will vary depending on client’s objectives, risk, and goals. If for example a client want’s a tax efficient account with a beta close to 1 of the s&p 500 with long term goals of 20+ years, they may have a different construction and more equity than someone with a horizon of 5 years. Here is a suggestion for a tax-efficient, diversified portfolio meeting a 20+ year time horizon with beta of 1.0 to S&P 500, * 50% in broad market equity ETFs like SPY (S&P 500) or VTI (total US stock market), and a growth market of EFG (MSCI EAFE Growth ETF). This provides market-matching beta, correlation and growth over the long term.* 20% in municipal bonds or muni bond ETFs like MUB. This provides tax-free income and stability. You can select various maturities based on the client's time horizon. A client could also purchase individual municipal bonds for the state they live in for potential state tax free income. * 15% in corporate bond ETFs like LQD (investment grade) or HYG (high yield). This provides additional income potential but interest is taxable. Higher risk but higher expected return than munis.* 10% in real estate via REIT ETF like VNQ. This provides portfolio diversification, partial inflation protection and income.* 5% in commodities via commodity ETF like DBC. This provides inflation protection and diversification as commodities have low correlation to equities and bonds.This is just a suggestion and a general example, but it covers the major asset classes, provides a balanced mix of growth and income, and opportunity for tax efficiency. You can then customize the allocations based on the client's specific goals and risk tolerance.Some other tax-efficient securities to consider include:* Municipal bonds (munis): Interest is tax-free, so they are suitable for taxable accounts. maturities can be tailored to time horizon.* Treasury bonds: Interest is taxable but very safe. Short-term bonds can provide stability with lower interest rate risk.* TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities): Interest is taxable but principal adjusts with inflation. Good for inflation protection and stability.* MLPs (Master Limited Partnerships): Distributions are tax-deferred. Higher risk but provide exposure to energy infrastructure. Suitable for tax-deferred accounts.* Dividend-paying stocks: Qualified dividends are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Provides equity exposure with income. Better in tax-deferred accounts if dividends are not qualified.To ensure tax efficiency, the portfolio can be structured to minimize capital gains and maximize tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s. Additionally, tax-loss harvesting strategies can be implemented to offset gains with losses and reduce the tax impact of the portfolio.
