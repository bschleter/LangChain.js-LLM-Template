C.19 B. Retiree Health CostsOne way to incorporate expected retiree health costs into a client’s retirement plan is by using planning scenarios that show clients how much they would need to save to cover health care costs after they retire1. Planners can incorporate health care expense planning into the financial and retirement plans that they create for clients. While a financial planner is not a physician, discussing your health, family longevity and history, and lifestyle is a good start to allow them to incorporate a range of expected medical costs and financial tools that could be available to you. The average American couple retiring at age 65 with Medicare will need ~$295,000 in after-tax savings to meet health care expenses in retirement according to a 2020 estimate2. While this seems like an extraordinary large number, this is based on healthcare costs, insurance, and just basic needs over the rest of your lifetime. As we get older, we have more and more expensive treatments, and more frequent care needed. There are several common medical expenses that people tend to overlook in retirement. Here are a few examples:1. Long-term care expenses: Many people assume that Medicare will cover long-term care expenses, but in reality, it only covers a very limited amount of long-term care in certain situations. If you require long-term care in retirement, the costs can be significant and may require additional insurance coverage or other financial planning strategies. Nowadays many permanent life insurance policies can include a rider to use some of the death benefit or cash value for certain long term care costs. Long Term care policies are best for people in median asset range i.e. where they have enough assets for retirement, but not enough assets to self insure themselves for long term care facility costs. Relying upon one’s family is not always the best plan for long term care. 2. Dental and vision care: Routine dental and vision care can be expensive, and Medicare does not cover most dental or vision services. It's important to budget for these expenses separately and consider purchasing additional insurance coverage if necessary.3. Hearing aids: As of 2022, Medicare also does not cover most hearing aids or related services, which can be a significant expense for retirees. Veterans in need of hearing aids may qualify for coverage through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and federal workers may be eligible for hearing aid coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which assists federal employees, their families and survivors with coverage of their health needs.4. Out-of-pocket costs: Even with insurance coverage, retirees may still have significant out-of-pocket costs for medical services such as copays, deductibles, and coinsurance.5. Alternative medical treatments: Alternative medical treatments such as acupuncture or chiropractic care may not be covered by insurance, but can be an important part of a retiree's healthcare plan. This includes clinical trials. This is why having savings simply for healthcare expenses for retirement is so important. Thus this is also why having an HSA is critically important as well as tax efficient if your health plan allows. Here's an example of a basic approach to estimating medical expenses in retirement:1.Start by reviewing the retiree's medical history and current health status. While something may not seem exactly relevant to you, it may be important for your financial planner to be aware of. Something as simple as hypertension is a relevant and important factor, as this does lead to increased medical costs later on, even if not exactly right now. Something as simple as this might lead to kidney issues later, dialysis, eye problems, stroke, which are all relatively expensive medical issues even though right now it’s being treated with a relatively inexpensive medication. This is why it is important to review certain medical conditions with your financial planner so they can get a gauge of what to potentially plan for so there isn’t any surprising changes that can throw the plan off. This can also be why finding a financial planner that is at least somewhat versed in medical conditions can be an extra perk. 2. Going over previous info again, it’s important to consider the retiree's lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise habits, and smoking status. Taking good care of your health is one of the best financial decisions you can do. These factors can impact a person's overall health and likelihood of developing certain medical conditions, which can lead to much higher healthcare costs.3.Factor in the retiree's healthcare coverage options, such as Medicare or private insurance plans. A brief overview of Medicare Parts and plans:The key types of Medicare plans are: Original Medicare (Part A and B). Part A covers Hospital Insurance (inpatient stays, skilled nursing facility) and Part B covers Medical Insurance (doctor’s services, outpatient care, medical supples and preventative services like checkups and vaccines). Medicare Advantage (Part C) is run by private insurance companies as alternative to original Medicare, including Part A and B, and most times Part D drug coverage. Medicare (Part D) Prescription Drug Coverage covers prescription drugs. Easy way to remember is Part D=drugs. Medigap coverage are (Supplemental) Plans, but generally not available to those under 65 with Medicare coverage with a disability.As such, Medigap coverage plans generally have more benefits and cost coverage than some Medicare Advantage plans, because the Medicare Advantage plans are not legally required to offer Part D type benefits. Note: If you’re in a plan that doesn’t have Part D coverage, and you don’t have Part D separately, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty if you decide to join a Medicare drug plan later. You can choose a mix of these plans based on your needs and budget, and discussing with a health insurance agent on costs of each is a great start to discuss with your financial planner. Every state is different in terms of costs because insurance is regulated on a state by state basis. For Medicare, most retirees will have Medicare at age 65, with the need to have a supplemental plan to cover the 20% of costs that Medicare doesn’t cover. This might involve researching different healthcare plans and estimating the costs associated with each option. These costs need to be factored into the projections for the retirement plan. 4. Consider any potential changes in healthcare costs over time, such as changes to healthcare policy or advancements in medical treatments that may increase or decrease costs. Typically with advancements in healthcare, this will lead to increased costs. Example: Wet age related macular degeneration was previous untreatable before the 2000’s. This condition to central vision blindness over time. However due to medical advancements this condition is now able to be treated with medication, however name brand medications are upwards of $2,000/eye and treatments can be monthly. This example is an important reason of why coverage such as Medigap is very important to cover the Part D for such medication, at $400/eye/month. A common condition without appropriate coverage such as this can be detrimental and seriously impact a retirement plan to the downside.  5. Use the previous steps to estimate a range of potential medical expenses in retirement, and factor that range into the overall retirement plan budget. If the costs of Medicare and accompanying plans are known, as well as currentdeductibles, coinsurance, and potential medical costs are estimated, you can use those figures to input values for the costs over the retiree's lifetime. Be aware that these costs aren’t always linear with inflation, so there needs to be some extra room planned in the emergency savings over time for medical costs. A good rule of thumb for retiree medical insurance is to at least have the amount of your deductible in emergency savings and estimated into your yearly retirement withdrawals. Of course, these tips are just a basic approach and there are many variables to consider when estimating medical expenses in retirement. It's always best to work with a financial planner or health insurance professional who can help provide more personalized guidance based on a retiree's unique situation.A great tip if you have an Health Savings Account (HSA), is that once you’re on Medicare, you can use it to pay the following healthcare expenses without having to withdraw from your IRA and increasing your taxable income. You can use your HSA for:* Out of pocket expenses on Medicare* Long Term care insurance premiums* Medicare Part B Premiums. A neat trick is even if you pay your Part B with your Social Security retirement, you can reimburse yourself. * Medicare Advantage Part C* Medicare Part D prescription drug plan You can still fund your HSA even if you retire before 65, Here's a basic formula you can use to estimate retiree health costs:Add- Medicare Part A and B premium, medigap coverage, drug costs, total deductibles and any coinsurance. For Medicare Advantage Plans- add Medicare Advantage premium, Part D coverage if needed, deductible, coinsurance, and any potential out of pocket costs. RMAA stands for Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount. It refers to surcharges added to Medicare Part B and D premiums for higher-income beneficiaries. This is Medicare's means testing - if your income exceeds certain thresholds, you pay higher premiums to cover a larger share of Medicare costs.The income thresholds and surcharge amounts change each year. For example, in 2020, if your individual income is above $87,000, you pay an additional $57.80 to $347 per month for Part B and potentially an additional amount for Part D. Married couples have higher income thresholds before surcharges apply. The goal of IRMAA is for higher-income seniors to pay a larger percentage of Medicare costs, rather than having all taxpayers subsidize more of the premiums regardless of income.Medicare Part B And Part D Prescription Drug Coverage For Year 2023 IRMAA Tables1. Single, head–of–household, or qualifying widow(er) with dependent child tax filing statusIf MAGI in 2021 (or 2020 if 2021 is not available) was:Then the Part B Premium* is:Prescription Drug Coverage Premium** is:More than $97,000 but less than or equal to $123,000$230.80$12.20+ Plan premiumMore than $123,000 but less than or equal to $153,000$329.70$31.50+ Plan premiumMore than $153,000 but less than or equal to $183,000$428.60$50.70+ Plan premiumMore than $183,000 but less than $500,000  Greater than or equal to $500,000$527.50  $560.50 $70.00+ Plan premium $76.40+ Plan Premium2. Married filing jointly tax filing statusIf MAGI in 2021 (or 2020 if 2021 is not available) was:Then the Part B Premium* is:Prescription Drug Coverage Premium** is:More than $194,000 but less than or equal to $246,000$230.80$12.20+ Plan premiumMore than $246,000 but less than or equal to $306,000$329.70$31.50+ Plan premiumMore than $306,000 but less than or equal to $366,000$428.60$50.70+ Plan premiumMore than $366,000 but less than $750,000  Greater than or equal to $750,000$527.50  $560.50$70.00+ Plan premium $76.40+ Plan Premium3. Married filing separately tax filing statusIf MAGI in 2021 (or 2020 if 2021 is not available) was:Then the Part B Premium* is:Prescription Drug Coverage Premium** is:More than $97,000 but less than $403,000  Greater than or equal to $403,000$527.50  $560.50$ 70.00+ Plan premium $76.40+ Plan PremiumLong Term Care Expenses ReviewThere are several financial planning strategies to consider when it comes to long-term care expenses in retirement. Here are a few examples:1. Long-term care insurance: A long-term care insurance policy can help cover the costs of long-term care, including nursing home care, assisted living facilities, and in-home care. This type of insurance can be costly, but it can also provide important financial protection in the event that you require long-term care.2. Self-insurance: If you have significant assets, you may choose to self-insure for long-term care expenses by setting aside funds specifically for this purpose. This can be a risky strategy, however, as the cost of long-term care can be unpredictable and may exceed your available resources.3. Medicaid planning: Medicaid can provide coverage for long-term care expenses, but there are strict eligibility requirements, and you may need to spend down your assets in order to qualify. Working with a financial advisor or elder law attorney can help you develop a Medicaid planning strategy that meets your needs. Keep in mind the five year lookback period with trusts to ‘protect’ assets for Medicaid qualification purposes. Further, assets must be in an irrevocable trust, limiting your access. The main answer I typically give to clients planning for long term care is -you don’t want to have to apply to Medicaid as benefits can be stingy, determination of care is limited, and even subject to political risk depending on Medicaid funding. 4. Hybrid insurance policies: Some insurance companies offer hybrid insurance policies that combine long-term care insurance with another type of insurance, such as life insurance or annuities. These policies can provide both long-term care coverage and other benefits, but they can also be complex and costly. Make sure they cover what you may need, or offer flexibility in how you spend the benefits such as using for home health care or requiring receipts. 5. Family support: In some cases, family members may be able to provide some or all of the necessary long-term care, which can significantly reduce expenses. However, it's important to consider the emotional and physical toll that caregiving can take on family members, and while this may seem like the ideal, cheaper, and easy option today, keep in mind attitudes and ability of this may change in the future. As a planner, I know you spent your life and a good sum of money raising your children, but it’s never a guarantee nor a requirement the children do the same for you. Further, even though they may care for you, generally when people require long term care it is beyond the basic ability of your familie’s abilities physically and financially. Keep in mind as an example- there will be times they will have to go to work and cant stay to take care of you.
