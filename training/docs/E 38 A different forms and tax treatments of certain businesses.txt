E.38A Organization form and the tax treatment of income, expenses, payroll, and wage taxes for different businesses Organizational form refers to the legal structure of a business entity, while tax treatment refers to how the entity is taxed by the government. Here are the differences between the organizational form and the tax treatment of income, expenses, payroll and wage taxes for sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLPs, LLCs, S-corps and C-corps:1. Sole Proprietorship:Organizational Form: A sole proprietorship is a business owned by one individual.Tax Treatment: The owner reports all income and expenses on their personal tax return (Form 1040). They are responsible for paying self-employment taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes) on their net income.2. Partnership:Organizational Form: A partnership is a business owned by two or more individuals.Tax Treatment: The partnership files an information return (Form 1065) to report income and expenses. The partners receive a K-1 form showing their share of the partnership's income, deductions, and credits, which they report on their personal tax returns. Partners are responsible for paying self-employment taxes on their share of the partnership's net income.3. LLP (Limited Liability Partnership):Organizational Form: An LLP is a partnership where the partners have limited liability.Tax Treatment: The LLP is taxed like a partnership, but the partners have limited liability.4. LLC (Limited Liability Company):Organizational Form: An LLC is a business entity that combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership.Tax Treatment: An LLC can choose to be taxed like a sole proprietorship (if there is only one owner), a partnership (if there are multiple owners), an S-corporation, or a C-corporation. The owners pay self-employment taxes on their share of the net income if the LLC is taxed like a sole proprietorship or partnership.5. S-Corp:Organizational Form: An S-corp is a corporation that meets certain IRS requirements to be taxed like a partnership.Tax Treatment: The S-corp files an information return (Form 1120S) to report income and expenses. The shareholders receive a K-1 form showing their share of the S-corp's income, deductions, and credits, which they report on their personal tax returns. The S-corp does not pay federal income tax, but the shareholders pay self-employment taxes on their share of the net income.6. C-Corp:Organizational Form: A C-corp is a business entity that is separate from its owners.Tax Treatment: The C-corp files a corporate tax return (Form 1120) to report income and expenses. The corporation pays federal income tax on its net income, and the shareholders pay taxes on any dividends they receive. The corporation may also be subject to payroll taxes on wages paid to employees.
