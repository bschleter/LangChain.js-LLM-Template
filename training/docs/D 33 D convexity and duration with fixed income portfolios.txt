D.33D Apply duration and convexity to fixed income portfolios Convexity and duration are two important risk metrics for fixed income portfolios:* Duration measures a portfolio's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. A higher duration means the portfolio value is more sensitive to rate changes. Managing duration can help control interest rate risk. You can adjust duration by changing the maturities or types of bonds in the portfolio.* Convexity measures how duration changes with interest rates. It captures the curvature of a bond's price-yield relationship. Higher convexity means the bond's price is more sensitive to large changes in rates. Convexity allows you to manage the portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate volatility. You can adjust convexity by changing the types and maturities of bonds in the portfolio.When managing a fixed income portfolio, you can use duration and convexity to:* Control interest rate risk by keeping duration within a target range* Reduce volatility by managing the convexity of the portfolio* Achieve a desired yield curve exposure by selecting bonds of specific maturities* Meet investment objectives by balancing risks and returns through duration and convexity management.Duration and convexity are two important concepts in fixed income investing that can help investors manage risk and maximize returns. Here are some ways to apply duration and convexity to fixed income portfolios:1. Understand the relationship between interest rates and bond prices: Duration measures the sensitivity of a fixed income security's price to changes in interest rates. A security with a longer duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a security with a shorter duration. This means that when interest rates rise, the price of a security with a longer duration will fall more than the price of a security with a shorter duration. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the price of a security with a longer duration will rise more than the price of a security with a shorter duration.2. Use duration to manage interest rate risk: Duration can be used to manage interest rate risk in a fixed income portfolio by matching the duration of the portfolio to the investor's desired investment horizon. For example, if an investor has a 10-year investment horizon, they may want to invest in bonds with a duration of around 10 years to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on the portfolio.3. Consider convexity to enhance returns: Convexity measures the curvature of the relationship between bond prices and interest rates. A security with positive convexity will have a higher price when interest rates fall and a lower price when interest rates rise, compared to a security with no convexity. This means that securities with positive convexity can provide higher returns than securities with no convexity, all else being equal.4. Diversify across different fixed income securities: A fixed income portfolio can benefit from diversification across different securities with different durations and convexities. This can help reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns by taking advantage of opportunities in different segments of the fixed income market.5. Monitor and adjust the portfolio over time: It's important to monitor the duration and convexity of a fixed income portfolio over time and adjust it as needed to align with the investor's goals and risk tolerance. This may involve periodic rebalancing to maintain the desired duration and convexity targets, or adjusting the portfolio in response to changes in market conditions.
