G.62C. Other forms of postmortem planning. Estate tax installment payments, stock redemptions for tax payments, special use valuations and elections against a will. 1. Estate Tax Installment Payments 6166: The estate tax installment payment option allows the estate to pay the estate tax liability in installments over a period of time, rather than in a lump sum. This option may be useful when the estate includes illiquid assets, such as real estate or a business, that cannot be sold quickly to pay the estate tax liability. The installment payments must include interest on the unpaid balance, and the estate must file Form 706-GS(D) to elect this option.2. Stock Redemptions for Tax Payments (Section 303): In some cases, the decedent may have owned stock in a closely held business that can be used to pay the estate tax liability. The stock can be redeemed by the business, and the proceeds can be used to pay the estate tax liability. This option may be useful when the business has sufficient cash flow to redeem the stock and when other sources of funds are not available. Value of stock must exceed 35% of decedent’s gross estate. Only an amount of stock equal to a total of all estate taxes and administration expenses can be redeemed. 3. Special Use Valuations 2032A: The special use valuation option allows certain types of property, such as farms or closely held businesses, to be valued at a lower rate for estate tax purposes. This option may be useful when the property is integral to the decedent's business or family and would be difficult to sell without significant disruption. The special use valuation option requires the estate to file Form 706 and meet certain requirements, such as ownership and use tests. It must meet two rules: 50% of gross estate must consist of real and personal property used in the business, and 25% of the gross estate must consist of real property used in the business. 4. Elections Against a Will: In some cases, it may be advantageous for a surviving spouse to elect against the decedent's will and instead take a share of the estate based on state law. This option may be useful when the surviving spouse would receive a larger share of the estate under state law than under the decedent's will. The election against a will must be made within a certain time period and requires the surviving spouse to waive any benefits under the decedent's will.Estate tax installment Payments review:It grants the estate a deferral period to make "interest only" payments for the first four years, with the first installment tax and interest due on the 5th year. The gross estate must be closely held, the value of which exceeds 35% of the adjusted gross estate. Property must be in sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation and aggregation of various business interests of the decedent is allowed for purposes of meeting the percentage requirement, provided the decedent owned at least 20% of the total value of each.
