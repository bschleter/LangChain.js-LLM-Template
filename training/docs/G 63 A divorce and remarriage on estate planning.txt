G.63A.Impact of divorce or remarriage on estate plan including asset titling and distribution, changes in beneficiary status and selection of heirsDivorce or remarriage can have significant impacts on an estate plan, particularly with regard to asset titling and distribution, changes in beneficiary status, and the selection of heirs. Here are some examples of how these changes can affect an estate plan:1. Asset titling and distribution: In many cases, a divorce or remarriage may require a change in the way assets are titled or distributed. For example, if a couple owns property jointly, a divorce may require that the property be divided and titled individually. Similarly, if one spouse has children from a previous marriage, a remarriage may require that assets be distributed in a way that provides for both the new spouse and the children.2. Changes in beneficiary status: A divorce or remarriage may also require a change in beneficiary status for life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and other assets that require the designation of a beneficiary. It is important to review and update beneficiary designations regularly to ensure that they reflect current wishes and circumstances.3. Selection of heirs: A divorce or remarriage may also require a change in the selection of heirs. For example, if a couple has children from previous marriages, a remarriage may require that the estate plan provide for both sets of children. Similarly, if a beneficiary dies or becomes incapacitated, the estate plan may need to be updated to reflect a new selection of heirs.
