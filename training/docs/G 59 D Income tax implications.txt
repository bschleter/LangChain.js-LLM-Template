G.59D. Income tax implications of trust income and distributionsTrusts are subject to income tax on their taxable income, and the tax implications of trust income and distributions depend on several factors, including the type of trust, the source of the income, and the timing and nature of the distributions. Here are some general principles to keep in mind:1. Trust income tax: Trusts are subject to income tax on their taxable income, which includes income from investments, rental income, and other sources. The tax rates that apply to trusts are different from those that apply to individuals, and the rates increase quickly as income rises. It is important for trustees to file tax returns for the trust each year and to pay any taxes owed.2. Distributions to beneficiaries: When a trust distributes income or principal to beneficiaries, the tax implications will depend on the nature of the distribution. Distributions of income are generally taxable to the beneficiaries in the year they are received, while distributions of principal are generally not taxable. However, there are exceptions and special rules that can apply, depending on the type of trust and the nature of the distribution.3. Timing of distributions: The timing of trust distributions can also affect the tax implications. For example, if a trust distributes income in a year when it has little or no taxable income, the beneficiaries may be subject to a higher tax rate than if the distribution had been made in a year with more taxable income.4. Type of trust: The type of trust can also affect the tax implications of trust income and distributions. For example, grantor trusts, which are trusts in which the grantor retains certain powers or benefits, are generally not subject to separate income tax and are instead taxed on the grantor's personal tax return.Trusts are subject to income tax on their taxable income, and the tax rates that apply to trusts are different from those that apply to individuals. Here are the current tax rates that apply to trusts for the tax year 2023:1. For taxable income up to $2,900, the tax rate is 10%.2. For taxable income between $2,900 and $10,550, the tax rate is 24%.3. For taxable income between $10,550 and $14,450, the tax rate is 35%.4. For taxable income above $14,450, the tax rate is 37%.It is important to note that these tax rates are for federal income tax only, and that trusts may also be subject to state income tax, depending on where the trust is located and where its income is earned.In addition to the tax rates, trusts may also be subject to the net investment income tax (NIIT), which is a 3.8% tax on net investment income, such as interest, dividends, and capital gains. The NIIT applies to trusts that have net investment income over certain thresholds, which are currently $14,450 for estates and trusts in 2023.Non-Grantor Trusts:Non-grantor trusts are trusts in which the grantor does not retain any powers or benefits. Non-grantor trusts are separate tax-paying entities and are required to file their own tax returns.Simple Non-Grantor Trusts:A simple non-grantor trust is a trust that distributes all of its income to the beneficiaries each year. The trust is not allowed to accumulate income, and all income is taxed to the beneficiaries. The trust is allowed to deduct certain expenses, such as trustee fees and legal fees. For a trust to be considered a simple trust for tax purposes, it must meet three tests:1. The trust must distribute all of its income currently. A simple trust cannot accumulate income, and any income earned by the trust must be distributed to the beneficiaries each year.2. The trust must distribute only income, and not principal. Distributions of principal are not considered part of a simple trust's income and are therefore not deductible by the trust.3. The trust must not have any charitable beneficiaries. A simple trust is only allowed to distribute income to individual or non-charitable beneficiaries.Meeting these three tests allows a simple trust to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the tax code.Complex Non-Grantor Trusts:A complex non-grantor trust is a trust that is not a simple trust. Complex trusts are allowed to accumulate income and are subject to different tax rules than simple trusts. The trust is allowed to deduct certain expenses, such as trustee fees and legal fees.
