G.56B. Explain roles of parties used in estate planning including executor, trustee, power of attorney, beneficiaries, heirs, and guardians. Estate planning involves several parties who play different roles in ensuring that a person's assets are distributed according to their wishes after their death. Here are the roles of the parties involved in estate planning:1. Executor: The executor is the person appointed in a will to manage the estate and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries. The executor's responsibilities include gathering and valuing the assets, paying any debts and taxes owed by the estate, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries according to the instructions in the will.2. Trustee: The trustee is the person or entity responsible for managing the assets in a trust and distributing them to the beneficiaries according to the instructions in the trust document. The trustee's responsibilities include managing the assets, making distributions to the beneficiaries, and keeping accurate records of all transactions.3. Power of attorney: A power of attorney is a legal document that gives a person the authority to act on behalf of another person in legal and financial matters. The person who grants the power of attorney is known as the principal, while the person who is granted the power of attorney is known as the agent. The agent can make decisions and take actions on behalf of the principal, such as paying bills, managing investments, and making healthcare decisions.4. Beneficiary(ies): A beneficiary is a person or entity who receives assets from a will, trust, or other estate planning document. The beneficiary can be an individual, a charity, or another organization. The beneficiary may receive specific assets or a share of the estate.5. Heirs: Heirs are people who are entitled to receive assets under state law if a person dies without a will. Heirs are determined based on state law and may include spouses, children, parents, and other close relatives.6. Guardians: Guardians are people appointed to care for minor children or incapacitated adults who are unable to care for themselves. Guardians are responsible for the day-to-day care of the person, including providing food, shelter, and medical care
