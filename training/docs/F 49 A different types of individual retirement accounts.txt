F.49A Different types of individual retirement accountsIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts that allow individuals to save for retirement with certain tax benefits. Here's a breakdown of the various types of IRAs and their tax treatment:1. Traditional IRA: Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, meaning that they can be deducted from taxable income in the year they are made. The contributions grow tax-deferred until they are withdrawn, at which point they are taxed as ordinary income. Withdrawals are penalty-free after age 59 1/2 and are required to begin at age 72.2. Rollover IRA: A rollover IRA is created by rolling over funds from a qualified retirement plan, such as a 401(k), into an IRA. The tax treatment is the same as a traditional IRA.3. Roth IRA: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made after-tax, meaning that they are not tax-deductible. However, the contributions grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are also tax-free. Qualified withdrawals are penalty-free after age 59 1/2, and there are no required minimum distributions (RMDs) for Roth IRAs during the lifetime of the original owner.4. SEP IRA: A Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA is a retirement plan for self-employed individuals or small business owners. Contributions are tax-deductible and grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and there are required minimum distributions starting at age 72. All contributions much be equal across employees by wage %. 5. SIMPLE IRA: A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA is a retirement plan for small businesses with up to 100 employees. Contributions are tax-deductible and grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and there are required minimum distributions starting at age 72.In summary, traditional, rollover, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth, with withdrawals taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs offer after-tax contributions and tax-free growth, with qualified withdrawals also tax-free.The contribution limits for each type of IRA can vary based on age, income, and other factors. Here are the current contribution limits for 2023:1. Traditional IRA and Roth IRA: The maximum contribution limit for both traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500 per year for individuals under age 50. For individuals age 50 and older, there is a catch-up contribution limit of an additional $1,000 per year, bringing the total contribution limit to $7,500 per year.2. SEP IRA: The maximum contribution limit for a SEP IRA is the lesser of 25% of compensation or $66,000 for 2023.3. SIMPLE IRA: The maximum contribution limit for a SIMPLE IRA is $15,500 for 2023. For individuals age 50 and older, there is a catch-up contribution limit of an additional $3,500 per year, bringing the total contribution limit to $19,000 per year.For Roth IRA income limits to contributions, if you are married and filing jointly, the modified AGI (adjusted gross income) has to be less than $218,000. If over, up to $228,000, you can contribute a reduced amount. If you are single, your AGI can be $138,000 to contribute the maximum amount, and if over that amount but under $153,000, you can contribute a reduced amount into a Roth IRA. If your AGI is over $153,000, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA.
