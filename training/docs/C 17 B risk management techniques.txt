C.17B. Four types of risk management techniquesThere are four main risk management techniques that can be used to manage and mitigate risks. These techniques are avoidance, diversification, reduction, retention, and transfer. Here's an overview of each technique:1. Avoidance: Avoidance involves taking steps to completely eliminate a risk. This may involve avoiding certain activities, locations, or investments that are deemed too risky. For example, a company may choose to avoid entering a new market that is known to be highly volatile and unpredictable.An example of when avoidance would be the best risk management technique is when a company is considering entering a new market that is known to be highly volatile and unpredictable. In this scenario, the company may decide that the potential risks associated with entering the market are too great, and that it would be best to avoid the market altogether.For example, imagine that a company that manufactures luxury goods is considering entering a new market in a developing country. However, the country has a history of political instability, economic volatility, and a high degree of corruption. The company may determine that the potential risks associated with entering this market are too great, and that the best course of action is to avoid the market altogether.2. Diversification: Diversification involves spreading risk across different assets or investments to reduce the impact of a single risk. This may involve investing in a variety of different stocks, bonds, or other assets to reduce the impact of market volatility. Diversification can help to reduce risk without eliminating it completely.An example of diversification is an investor who spreads their investment portfolio across multiple asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. By diversifying their portfolio, the investor is reducing their exposure to the risks associated with any one asset class.For example, imagine that an investor has $100,000 to invest. Instead of investing all of the money in stocks, the investor decides to diversify their portfolio by investing $50,000 in stocks, $30,000 in bonds, and $20,000 in real estate. By diversifying their portfolio in this way, the investor is spreading their risk across multiple asset classes.3. Reduction: Risk reduction involves taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. This may involve implementing controls or procedures to minimize the impact of a risk if it occurs. An example of risk reduction is a manufacturing company that implements a quality control program to reduce the risk of defects in their products. By implementing quality control procedures, the company is taking steps to reduce the likelihood and impact of defects, which could lead to product recalls, lost sales, and damage to the company's reputation.For example, imagine that a toy manufacturer has experienced several product recalls due to defects in their products. In response, the company implements a quality control program that includes regular inspections, testing, and monitoring of the manufacturing process. By implementing these procedures, the company is reducing the risk of defects in their products and improving the overall quality of their products.4. Transfer: Risk transfer involves transferring the risk to another party, such as an insurance company or a third-party vendor. This may involve purchasing insurance to cover potential losses or outsourcing certain activities to a third-party vendor who is better equipped to manage the associated risks.An example of risk transfer is a company that purchases insurance to cover potential losses or liabilities. By transferring the risk to an insurance company, the company is shifting the financial burden of the risk to the insurance company in exchange for paying a premium.For example, imagine that a construction company is working on a large-scale project that involves a high degree of risk, such as building a skyscraper. The company may purchase insurance to cover potential losses or liabilities associated with the project, such as property damage, personal injury, or construction defects. By transferring the risk to an insurance company, the construction company is reducing its exposure to the financial impact of potential losses or liabilities.
