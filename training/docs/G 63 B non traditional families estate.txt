G.63B. Strategies for appropriate management of same-sex, non-traditional or non-married persons.  This may depend also on a state by state basis, as some states are tenants in common states and some are community property states. Some also may be elective community property states. 1. Create a will: One of the most basic and important steps for anyone who wants to ensure that their assets are properly managed and distributed is to create a will. A will allows you to specify who you want to inherit your assets and how you want them to be distributed, however wills can be contested by family members. Will contests are initiated typically by a disenchanted beneficiary or disinherited beneficiary who seeks a great portion of estate. No wills means the court will decide disposition of assets however, and can be a long probate process. 2. Establish a trust: A trust is a legal arrangement that can provide more control over the management and distribution of assets. A certain type of trust can also provide tax benefits and other advantages, such as protection from creditors or lawsuits. A revocable trust or possibly tenancy in common are good solutions for non-traditional families, dependent on situation however. A trust can be especially useful for same-sex and non-traditional couples who may not have the same legal rights and protections as married couples.3. Designate beneficiaries: Many types of financial accounts and assets, such as life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and bank accounts, allow you to designate beneficiaries. This means that the assets will pass directly to the designated beneficiaries without going through probate. Designating beneficiaries can be a simple and effective way to ensure that your assets go to the people you want to inherit them.4. Establish power of attorney: Power of attorney is a legal document that allows someone else to make financial and legal decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated. Establishing power of attorney can be important for same-sex and non-traditional couples who may not have the same legal rights and protections as married couples. Powers of attorney can also be helpful during medical procedures, incapacitation, etc. 5. Create a cohabitation agreement: A cohabitation agreement is a legal document that can establish the rights and responsibilities of unmarried partners who live together. A cohabitation agreement can cover issues such as property ownership, financial support, and end-of-life decisions. Creating a cohabitation agreement can help ensure that both partners are protected and that their wishes are respected.Being unmarried, partners are not entitled to advantages provided by state law such as elective share or unlimited marital deductions.
