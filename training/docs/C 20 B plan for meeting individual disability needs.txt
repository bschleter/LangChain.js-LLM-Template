C.20B. Create and plan for meeting individual disability income needsBasics of disability:When selecting a disability insurance policy, there are several factors to consider. Here are some of the most important ones:1. Benefit amount: The benefit amount is the amount of money that you will receive from your insurance policy if you become disabled and are unable to work. You should consider your current income and expenses when deciding on a benefit amount.2. Waiting period: As we discussed earlier, the waiting period is the length of time that you will need to wait before your policy starts paying out benefits. You should consider how long you can realistically cover your expenses without income, and balance that with the cost of a shorter waiting period in terms of higher premiums.3. Length of coverage: You should consider how long you want your policy to provide benefits. Short-term disability policies typically cover up to six months, while long-term disability policies can cover several years or even until retirement age.4. Definition of disability: Different policies may define "disability" differently. Some policies might define disability as being unable to perform your current occupation, while others may require that you are unable to perform any occupation. You should consider which definition is most appropriate for you and your profession.5. Coverage exclusions and limitations: Some policies may exclude certain conditions from coverage, or have limitations on coverage for pre-existing conditions. You should carefully review any exclusions or limitations in a policy before purchasing it.6. Cost: Finally, you should consider the cost of the policy and how it fits into your overall budget. Remember that disability insurance premiums can vary widely depending on the benefit amount, waiting period, and other factors, so it's important to shop around and compare policies from different providers.With those factors in mind, here are some things to consider when planning for an individual’s disability needs:1. Assess the individual's income needs, and whether others are dependent on their income: The first step is to determine how much income the individual will need in the event of a disability. This will depend on factors such as the individual's current income, living expenses, and any outstanding debts or financial obligations. Disability covers around 60% to sometimes 70% of an individuals income. Depending on group (pre-tax) and individual (post-tax) coverage, this can vary on the amount of disability that is paid to an individual.  Further, disability gap analysis’s are important to run to see how much income is lost in event of a long term disability. While not only income is lost, it’s important to map out how much retirement savings and general asset accumulation can be lost as a result. This surprisingly can be in the millions. 2. Evaluate existing disability income coverage: The next step is to evaluate any existing disability income coverage that the individual may have, such as through an employer paying in pre-tax or having monthly limits. This can help identify any gaps in coverage that need to be addressed.With employer based long term disability, there is also sometimes a monthly limit for higher income earners. A typical example is an income limit of $12,000/month, or 60% of an individual’s income cannot be higher than $12,000/month, and if it is, then it would be less than 60% of individuals income coverage. In this example, an individual would have to be making more than $240,000/year. 	$240,000*0.6 (60% coverage)=$144,000 annually. 	$144,000/12 months= $12,000/month. 3. Research disability income insurance options: If the individual does not have sufficient disability income coverage, you may need to research options for purchasing a disability income insurance policy. This can involve comparing policies from different insurers and considering factors such as the policy's benefit amount, waiting period, and coverage exclusions.4. Identify any additional financial resources: In addition to disability income insurance, there may be other financial resources available to the individual in the event of a disability, such as savings or investments. These resources can help supplement disability income coverage and provide additional financial support.As discussed previously, it’s important to run a gap analysis to calculate income and savings lost in event of a disability. To do so you would Determine the individual's current income: The first step is to determine the individual's current income, including any salaries, wages, bonuses, or other sources of income.Identify existing disability income coverage: The next step is to identify any existing disability income coverage that the individual may have, such as through an employer or other source. This can help identify any gaps in coverage that need to be addressed.Calculate potential disability income: The next step is to calculate the potential disability income that the individual could receive from disability income insurance policies. This will depend on factors such as the benefit amount, waiting period, and coverage exclusions of the policies being considered.Determine potential savings loss: In addition to lost income, a disability can also result in increased expenses related to medical care and other needs. It's important to consider the potential loss of savings that may occur as a result of a disability, including any emergency funds or retirement savings that may be used to cover expenses.Compare income and savings loss to resources available: Once you have calculated the potential income and savings loss that may occur in the event of a disability, you can compare this to the individual's existing sources of income and financial resources. This can help identify any gaps in coverage that need to be addressed, as well as potential strategies for managing expenses and maintaining financial stability in the event of a disability.In this example, assume a worker is 40 and has an income of $200,000. They have normal lifestyle expenses such as mortgage, food, bills, insurance of $80,000/year. The worker saves into their 401(k) $21,000/year earning 7%, and it has a balance of $200,000. The worker also saves $15,000/year into savings for some emergencies, and saves $10,000/year into an investment account earning 6%/year. The rest of their income goes to taxes. The worker plans to work for 20 more years. If the worker did not have a disability policy:* The worker would not have a replacement of their $200,000/year income and the savings alongside it, and not have ability to pay the $80,000 in lifestyle expenses. * 401k: Assuming the worker has a current balance of $200,000 in their 401k account, and they will not be able to contribute any more due to disability, we can calculate the potential investment growth loss over a 20-year retirement timeline. Assuming an average annual return of 7%, the balance will grow to approximately $1,026,000 over the 20-year period. Therefore, the potential investment growth loss would be approximately $826,000 ($1,026,000 - $200,000).* Investment Account: Assuming the worker has a current balance of $50,000 in their investment account, and they will not be able to contribute any more due to disability, we can calculate the potential investment growth loss over a 20-year retirement timeline. Assuming an average annual return of 6%, the balance will grow to approximately $229,000 over the 20-year period. Therefore, the potential investment growth loss would be approximately $179,000 ($229,000 - $50,000).* Savings: Assuming the worker was saving $15,000 per year, and they will not be able to save any more due to disability. Assuming an average annual return of 0%, the total savings will grow to approximately $300,000 over the 20-year period. Therefore, the potential investment growth loss would be approximately $275,000 ($300,000 - $15,000).* Total lifestyle expenses lost of $80,000/year would be $1,600,000 of lifestyle expenses that they would not be able to cover that they normally did. This would equate to an approximate total loss of $1,280,000 of total investment loss over the 20 years. Combined with the lifestyle expenses loss of $1,600,000, this would mean a loss of $2,880,000 of potential life savings/income over the last 20 years of their working career. A disability policy covering 60% of their income post tax would cover at least $2,400,000 in expenses over the 20 year frame ((200,000*0.6)*20 years).
