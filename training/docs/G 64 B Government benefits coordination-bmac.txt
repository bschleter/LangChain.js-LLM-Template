G.64B. Compare and Coordinate other available sources or government benefitsThere are several sources of government benefits that can be used in special needs planning. Here are some of the most common:1. Supplemental Security Income (SSI): SSI is a federal program that provides financial assistance to individuals with disabilities who have limited income and resources. This program provides a monthly cash benefit that can be used to cover expenses such as food, housing, and healthcare.2. Medicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health insurance to individuals with low income and limited resources. Medicaid can cover a wide range of medical expenses, including long-term care.3. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI): SSDI is a federal program that provides benefits to individuals who have worked and paid into the Social Security system but have become disabled and are no longer able to work.4. Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance to individuals over the age of 65, as well as individuals with certain disabilities.5. Veterans Administration (VA) benefits: Veterans and their dependents may be eligible for a variety of VA benefits, including disability compensation, pension benefits, and medical care.6. State and local government programs: Many states and local governments offer programs that provide financial assistance, healthcare, and other services to individuals with disabilities and their families.SSI and SSDI are both government programs that provide financial assistance to individuals with disabilities, but they have different eligibility requirements and benefits.SSI, or Supplemental Security Income, is a needs-based program that provides financial assistance to individuals who have limited income and resources and are disabled or blind. SSI benefits are based on financial need and are not tied to an individual's work history. In order to be eligible for SSI, an individual must have limited income and resources, and must meet the Social Security Administration's definition of disability.SSDI, or Social Security Disability Insurance, is a program that provides benefits to individuals who have a qualifying work history and have become disabled and are no longer able to work. SSDI benefits are based on an individual's work history and the amount of Social Security taxes they have paid into the system. In order to be eligible for SSDI, an individual must have worked for a certain number of years and must meet the Social Security Administration's definition of disability.In general, SSI is best for individuals who have limited income and resources and are not able to work, while SSDI is best for individuals who have a work history and have become disabled and are no longer able to work. However, every situation is unique, and it is important to consult with a financial advisor or attorney to determine the best approach for your specific needs and goals.To find out qualifications: State government websites: have information and resources about disability benefit programs that are available in their state.
