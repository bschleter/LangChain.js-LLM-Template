C.21B. Develop appropriate long term care insurance plan based on needs, financial resources, policy coverage and costsFirst, it's important to consider the potential costs of long term care. Assuming that long term care costs continue to increase at an average rate of 3% per year, $5,000 per month in 25 years would be equivalent to approximately $10,000 per month in today's dollars. To do simple math, most long term care costs last 3-5 years. This would be about 360,000-600,000 in total costs in long term care. Now for many, long term care insurance is an option as they may not have the required assets to cover these costs in retirement, especially at the point in their retirement where long term care costs come into play, which is usually towards the end of retirement. Long term care insurance is best for those who may have assets dwindling down in the latter part of retirement and where additional long term care costs would deplete any funds. Take for example someone with $1,000,000 in assets at the beginning of their retirement. They earn 5%/year off their retirement funds, but draw down about $80,000/year from the account. Each year, their expenses of $60,000 goes up 2% with inflation. Based on the given information, here is the breakdown:YearAgeBeginning AssetsInterest EarnedExpensesInflation-Adjusted ExpensesEnding Assets165$1,000,000$50,000$60,000$61,200$990,000266$990,000$49,500$61,200$62,424$978,300367$978,300$48,915$62,424$63,672$964,791468$964,791$48,240$63,672$64,945$949,359569$949,359$47,468$64,945$66,244$931,882670$931,882$46,594$66,244$67,569$912,232771$912,232$45,612$67,569$68,920$890,275872$890,275$44,514$68,920$70,298$865,869973$865,869$43,293$70,298$71,704$838,8641074$838,864$41,943$71,704$73,138$809,1031175$809,103$40,455$73,138$74,601$776,4201276$776,420$38,820$74,601$76,093$740,6401377$740,640$37,032$76,093$77,615$701,5791478$701,579$35,079$77,615$79,167$659,0431579$659,043$32,952$79,167$80,750$612,8281680$612,828$30,641$80,750$82,365$562,7191781$562,719$28,136$82,365$84,012$508,4901882$508,490$25,425$84,012$85,692$449,9031983$449,903$22,495$85,692$87,406$386,7062084$386,706$19,335$87,406$89,154$318,635Each year, the retiree's assets will grow by 5% due to compounding interest, but the retiree will also withdraw money to cover expenses, which will increase each year to account for inflation. At the end of 20 years, when the retiree reaches age 85, the remaining assets will be approximately $245,413.In this example, if the retiree were to incur long term care expenses at the age of 85, or any age, the long term care expenses would deplete their account. This assuming long term care costs of around $5,000/month, at this cost rising at 2%/year which would mean the costs would be $7,429.80/month. However we know medical costs typically rise faster than general inflation. At $7,429.80/month, this equates to around $445,788 for five years of care if we don’t account for any further inflation, as the point is already made here. Even  if long term care was only three years, it would again still deplete the remaining assets, and that’s only for long term care costs, not including living expenses. The long term care costs would deplete the retirees account in either scenario. In scenarios such as described, it’s important to plan for long term costs, as many aren’t aware of the costs of care. It may be challenging to fully cover the costs of long term care for an extended period of time. However, there are several strategies that can be used to help manage these costs.One option is to purchase a long term care insurance policy. The cost of the policy will depend on factors such as your age, health, and the level of coverage you choose. However, a policy that provides a daily benefit of $200 and a benefit period of 5 years could help cover a significant portion of the expected costs.Another option is to consider a hybrid policy that includes both long term care insurance and permanent life insurance. This type of policy can provide benefits for both long term care and a death benefit to your beneficiaries if you do not use the long term care benefits. Many like this option, as it places a hedge that some assets can still potentially be delivered to the heirs if they don’t use the long term care rider on the life insurance, and money doesn’t go away paying for long term care premiums if they didn’t use the long term care insurance. Many don’t like the idea of paying for long term care insurance and potentially not utilizing it, further long term care must be looked at before 60, if not before 50 for premiums to be reasonable in costs.
