G. 57B. Identify the gift tax consequences of lifetime transfers to individuals and charitiesIf an individual makes a gift that exceeds the annual exclusion amount and reduces their lifetime exclusion amount, they may need to file a gift tax return with the IRS. The gift tax return is due on April 15th of the year following the gift.It’s also important to note that gifts to qualified charities are generally not subject to gift tax, regardless of the amount of the gift. However, the gift must be made directly to the charity and not to an intermediary, to qualify for the gift tax exclusion.There are several types of gifts that are exempt from gift tax in addition to the annual exclusion amount and gifts to qualified charities. Here are a few examples:1. Political contributions: An individual can make unlimited gifts to political organizations and candidates without incurring gift tax.2. Payments for medical or educational expenses: An individual can make unlimited payments for someone’s medical or educational expenses without incurring gift tax, but only if the payments are made directly to the medical or educational institution.3. Gifts to a spouse: Gifts made to a spouse who is a U.S. citizen are generally exempt from gift tax, regardless of the value of the gift.4. Gifts to a political spouse: Gifts made to the spouse of a political candidate or office holder for their campaign or political use are exempt from gift tax, up to a certain amount.5. Gifts to a qualified nonprofit organization: An individual can make gifts to certain nonprofit organizations that meet certain criteria without incurring gift tax.The annual exemption amount is for each donee, and are for present interests. Present interests are those when the enjoyment or use can start immediately whereas future interest by the terms of transfer delay possession or enjoyment. Gifts of future interests do not qualify for the annual exclusion.
