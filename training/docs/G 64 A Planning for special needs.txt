G.64 Planning for Special A. Features of government savings vehicles that provide for qualified disability expensesThere are several government savings vehicles that can provide for qualified disability expenses, including:1. ABLE accounts: ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts designed specifically for individuals with disabilities. Contributions to these accounts are made with after-tax dollars, but earnings on the account are tax-free. Funds can be used for qualified disability expenses such as education, housing, transportation, and healthcare.2. Special Needs Trusts (SNTs): SNTs are legal arrangements that hold assets for the benefit of an individual with a disability. These trusts can be funded with cash, securities, or other assets, and can be used to pay for a variety of expenses, including medical care, housing, and transportation.3. Medicaid Buy-In Programs: Medicaid Buy-In Programs allow individuals with disabilities to qualify for Medicaid coverage by paying a premium based on their income. This program can help cover the cost of medical expenses, including long-term care.4. Supplemental Security Income (SSI): SSI is a federal program that provides financial assistance to individuals with disabilities who have limited income and resources. This program provides a monthly cash benefit that can be used to cover expenses such as food, housing, and healthcare.ABLE AccountTo be eligible to open an ABLE account, a person must meet the following requirements:* They must be disabled as defined by the SSI program. This means they must have a condition that results in marked and severe functional limitations that can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months or can be expected to result in death.* The disability must have occurred before the age of 26.* They must be a US citizen or resident.* For beneficiaries over 65, they must have been receiving SSI or SSDI benefits for at least 3 months or be blind as defined by SSI.ABLE accounts and special needs trusts are two different types of savings vehicles that can help individuals with disabilities plan for their future and cover necessary expenses. Here are some of the key differences between the two, along with situations where one might be more appropriate than the other:1. Ownership: ABLE accounts are owned by the individual with a disability, while special needs trusts are owned by a trustee who manages the trust for the benefit of the individual with a disability.2. Funding: ABLE accounts are typically funded with after-tax dollars from the individual or their family members, while special needs trusts can be funded with a variety of assets, including cash, securities, and real estate.3. Tax treatment: Earnings on ABLE accounts are tax-free if they are used for qualified disability expenses, while special needs trusts are subject to income taxes on any earnings.4. Control: ABLE account owners have more control over the funds in the account, while special needs trust beneficiaries have less control over the funds held in the trust. The assets are managed by the trustee and dictated by the trust. 5. Government benefits: ABLE accounts can affect an individual's eligibility for government benefits like SSI if the account balance exceeds $100,000, while special needs trusts are designed to preserve an individual's eligibility for these benefits. Only assets above $100,000 count as a resource in these instances. A beneficiary's Medicaid continues when an SSI recipient's ABLE account exceeds $100,000 by an amount that causes the recipient to exceed the SSI resource limit--whether alone or with other resources. The recipient retains eligibility for Medical Assistance (Medicaid) without a time limit as long as he or she remains otherwise eligible. If ABLE resources above $100,000 cause an individual to exceed the resource limit, then Medicaid continues uninterrupted. If non ABLE resources over $100,000 cause an individual to exceed the resource limit, Medicaid is suspended.If an ABLE account beneficiary dies before age 65, the remaining balance in the account can be distributed tax-free to the beneficiary's estate or designated beneficiaries. This allows the funds to be passed on to family members or used to cover any final expenses. Without this provision, any funds remaining in an ABLE account when the beneficiary dies before 65 would be forfeited. So the account can provide some benefit even if the beneficiary passes away prior to reaching the age limit. The specific distribution rules would depend on how the account is set up and who is named as beneficiaries.--------------------------Based on these differences, here are some situations where one type of account might be more appropriate than the other in terms of Special Needs Trust vs. an ABLE account:- For individuals with a disability who have assets or income that exceed the limits for government benefits, a special needs trust might be more appropriate.- For individuals with a disability who want more control over their funds and want to manage their own finances, an ABLE account might be more appropriate.- For families who want to leave a legacy or provide for their loved one with a disability after they pass away, a special needs trust might be more appropriate. While it may cost more and be more complicated to setup, it is more ABLE accounts and special needs trusts are typically used by individuals with a wide range of disabilities. The eligibility criteria for ABLE accounts and special needs trusts are generally based on the individual's disability and the impact it has on their ability to work and support themselves.Here are some common disabilities that may qualify an individual for an ABLE account or special needs trust:* Intellectual disabilities* Developmental disabilities* Physical disabilities* Sensory disabilities (such as blindness or deafness)* Mental health conditions* Autism spectrum disorders* Traumatic brain injuries* Chronic illnessesSpecial Needs Trusts:- The trust must be irrevocable, which means that it cannot be changed or revoked once it is established.- The trust must be for the sole benefit of the individual with the disability.- The trust must be managed by a trustee who is responsible for managing the assets in the trust and making distributions to the beneficiary.- The trust must be established by someone other than the beneficiary with a disability, such as a parent or grandparent.- The trust must be established before the beneficiary turns 65, although there are exceptions to this rule in some cases.It is important to note that these requirements can vary widely depending on the state in which you reside. Some states may have additional eligibility criteria, residency requirements, or other restrictions. It is important to consult with a financial advisor or attorney to determine the requirements for opening an ABLE account or special needs trust in your specific state.The time it takes to create a special needs trust (SNT) can vary depending on several factors, including the complexity of the trust and the state in which it is being created. Generally, creating an SNT can take several weeks to several months.Here are some of the steps involved in creating an SNT and estimated timeframes for each step:1. Consultation with an attorney: The first step in creating an SNT is to consult with an attorney who specializes in estate planning and special needs planning. This consultation can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending on the complexity of the situation.2. Drafting the trust document: The attorney will work with the individual creating the trust to draft a trust document that meets their specific needs. This process can take several weeks, as the document may need to be revised and reviewed multiple times.3. Funding the trust: Once the trust document is complete, the assets that will be placed into the trust need to be identified and transferred. This process can take several weeks to several months, depending on the types of assets involved.4. Trust administration: Once the trust is funded, it will need to be managed by a trustee. This process can take several weeks to several months, depending on the complexity of the trust and the types of assets involved.A parent is often named as the trustee for a special needs trust for their disabled child. However, it is not required that a parent serve as trustee. The trustee of a special needs trust can be:* A parent or family member* A professional fiduciary (like a bank or lawyer)* A nonprofit organization* Really any competent and responsible partyThe key considerations in naming a trustee are:* The trustee must be responsible and trustworthy to properly manage the trust funds.* The trustee should understand the beneficiary's needs and be committed to using funds for the beneficiary's benefit.* There may be conflicts of interest if a family member serves as trustee, so a neutral third party may be preferable in some cases.So while a parent is a common choice, it depends on the particular situation and family dynamics. A professional trustee may be better suited if there are concerns about conflicts of interest or the parent's ability to properly manage the trust.In general, it is recommended that trustees for SNTs be individuals or entities that are familiar with the needs of individuals with disabilities and have experience managing trusts. This may include professional trustees, such as banks or other financial institutions, or family members or friends who have experience in financial management or special needs planning.When choosing a successor trustee for a special needs trust, it is important to choose someone who is willing and able to take on the responsibilities of managing the trust if the primary trustee is no longer able to serve. This may include family members, friends, or professional trustees. It is important to discuss this decision with all parties involved and to plan for contingencies such as illness, disability, or death of the primary trustee.The Most Important Distinction Two entirely different types of trusts are usually lumped together as “special needs” trusts. The two trust types will be treated differently for tax purposes, for benefit determinations, and for court involvement. For most of the discussion that follows, it will be necessary to first distinguish between the two types of trusts. The distinction is further complicated by the fact that the grantor (the person establishing the trust, and the easiest way to distinguish between the two trust types) is not always the person who actually signs the trust document. “Self-Settled” Special Needs Trusts Some trusts are established by the beneficiary (or by someone acting on his or her behalf) with the beneficiary’s funds for the purpose of retaining or obtaining eligibility for public benefits—such a trust is usually referred to as a “self-settled” special needs trust. The beneficiary might, for example, have received an outright inheritance, or won a lottery. By far the most common source of funds for “selfsettled” special needs trusts, however, is proceeds from a lawsuit—often (but not always) a lawsuit over the injury that resulted in the disability. Another common scenario requiring a person with a disability to establish a self-settled trust is when they receive a direct inheritance from a well-intentioned, but ill-advised relative. A given trust may be treated as having been “established” by the beneficiary even if the beneficiary is completely unable to execute documents, and even if a court, family member, or lawyer representing the beneficiary actually signed the trust documents. The key test in determining whether a trust is self-settled is to determine whether the beneficiary had the right to outright possession of the proceeds prior to the act establishing the trust. If so, public benefits eligibility rules will treat the beneficiary as having set up the trust even though the actual implementation may have been undertaken by someone else acting on their behalf. Virtually all special needs trusts established with funds recovered in litigation or through a direct inheritance will be “self-settled” trusts. Self-settled special needs trusts are different from thirdparty trusts in two important ways. First, self-settled trusts must include a provision directing the trustee, if the trust contains any funds upon the death of the beneficiary, to pay back anything the state Medicaid program has paid for the beneficiary. Second, in many states, the rules governing permissible distributions for self-settled special needs trusts 6 are significantly more restrictive than those controlling thirdparty special needs trusts. Because Social Security law specifically describes selfsettled special needs trusts, these instruments are sometimes referred to by the statutory section authorizing transfers to such trusts and directing that trust assets will not be treated as available and countable for SSI purposes. That statutory section is 42 U.S.C. §1396p(d)(4)(A), and so self-settled special needs trusts are sometimes called, simply, “d4A” trusts. “Third-party” Special Needs Trusts The second type of special needs trust is one established by someone other than the person with disabilities (usually, but not always, a parent) with assets that never belonged to the beneficiary. It is often used, when proper planning is done for a disabled person’s family, to hold an inheritance or gift. Without planning, a well-meaning family member might simply leave an inheritance to an individual with a disability. Even though it may be possible to set up a trust after the fact, the funds will have been legally available to the beneficiary. That means that any trust will probably be a “selfsettled” special needs trust, even though the funds came from a third party. Parents, grandparents and others with the foresight to leave funds in a third party special needs trust will provide significantly better benefits to the beneficiary who has a disability. This type of trust will not need to include a “payback” provision for Medicaid benefits upon the beneficiary’s death. During the beneficiary’s life, the kinds of payments the trust can make will usually be more generous and flexible.
