G.64E. Integrate intra-family and generational planning strategies to maximize financial security over an extended period of timeIntergenerational transfers refer to the transfer of wealth or assets from one generation to another. This can involve passing down assets such as property, businesses, or investments to younger family members, or making gifts or loans to support their education, healthcare, or other needs.There are several reasons why individuals may choose to engage in intergenerational transfers. For example:1. Building a Legacy: Intergenerational transfers can be a way to build a legacy and pass down family values and traditions to future generations.2. Providing Financial Security: Transferring wealth or assets to younger family members can help to provide financial security and support their long-term goals and aspirations.3. Minimizing Taxes: Intergenerational transfers can be used to minimize estate and gift taxes by transferring assets during an individual's lifetime.4. Facilitating Business Succession: Transferring ownership of a family business to the next generation can help to ensure its continued success and longevity.There are several ways to engage in intergenerational transfers, including:1. Gifting: Making gifts of cash or assets to younger family members can be a way to provide financial support and reduce the size of an individual's estate for tax purposes.2. Loans: Providing loans to younger family members can be a way to help them finance education, start a business, or purchase a home.3. Trusts: Trusts can be used to transfer assets to younger family members while providing asset protection and minimizing taxes.4. Family Partnerships: Family partnerships can be used to transfer ownership of a family business or property to younger family members while retaining some control over the assets.here are several common strategies for minimizing taxes associated with intergenerational transfers. Here are some examples:1. Annual Gift Tax Exclusion: The annual gift tax exclusion allows individuals to gift up to a certain amount each year to an unlimited number of recipients without incurring gift tax. For 2021, the annual gift tax exclusion is $15,000 per recipient. This can be an effective way to transfer wealth to younger family members without incurring gift or estate taxes.2. Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption: The lifetime gift tax exemption allows individuals to gift a certain amount over their lifetime without incurring gift or estate taxes. For 2021, the lifetime gift tax exemption is $11.7 million per person. This can be a useful strategy for transferring larger amounts of wealth to younger family members, particularly for individuals with significant assets.3. Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts: Irrevocable life insurance trusts can be used to transfer wealth to younger family members while minimizing estate taxes. This involves transferring ownership of a life insurance policy to a trust, which then pays out the proceeds to beneficiaries tax-free.4. Charitable Giving: Charitable giving can be an effective way to reduce the size of an individual's estate and minimize estate taxes. Charitable gifts are generally deductible from the donor's taxable income, and can be an effective way to support causes that are important to the family.5. Generation-Skipping Trusts: Generation-skipping trusts can be used to transfer wealth to future generations without incurring estate taxes. This involves transferring assets to a trust that is designed to benefit multiple generations, while skipping over the generation that is next in line to inherit.6. Family Limited Partnerships: Family limited partnerships can be used to transfer ownership of a family business or property to younger family members while minimizing taxes. This involves transferring ownership to a partnership, which then issues shares to family members.Generation Skipping Trusts scenarioGeneration-skipping trusts (GSTs) are a type of irrevocable trust that is designed to transfer assets to future generations without incurring estate taxes. These trusts are typically used to transfer wealth to grandchildren or great-grandchildren, rather than to an individual's children.The primary advantage of using a GST is that it allows individuals to transfer assets to multiple generations without incurring estate taxes at each level. This can be particularly advantageous for individuals with significant assets who want to ensure that their wealth is preserved for future generations.There are two types of GSTs: direct skip trusts and indirect skip trusts. Direct skip trusts involve transferring assets directly to grandchildren or great-grandchildren, while indirect skip trusts involve transferring assets to a trust that benefits multiple generations.If the money and assets are in a direct GST, the person who opens the trust will pay the tax and will set up a trust provision to pay it. If trust assets are in an indirect GST, the immediate beneficiary (the parent of the skip beneficiary(parent of grandchild)) won't pay taxes on it, but the skip beneficiary (grandchild) will. Those taxes can be paid out of the inheritance proceeds.One example of where a GST might be used over a grantor trust is in the case of a large family-owned business. In this scenario, the grantor may want to ensure that the business remains in the family for multiple generations, while also minimizing estate taxes. A GST can be used to transfer ownership of the business to a trust that is designed to benefit multiple generations, while minimizing taxes.A grantor trust, on the other hand, is a type of trust in which the grantor retains control over the assets and is responsible for paying taxes on the income generated by the trust. Grantor trusts are typically used for tax planning purposes, such as to transfer assets to a trust while retaining some control over the assets.Another use case of a GST is  for multi-generational family estate planning with tax benefits is in the case of a family with significant assets who want to pass those assets down to their grandchildren or great-grandchildren while minimizing estate taxes.For example, let's say that a family has a net worth of $30 million and wants to leave the majority of their assets to their grandchildren. If they were to leave those assets to their children first, they would be subject to estate taxes at that level before being passed down to the grandchildren. This could result in significant tax liabilities and reduce the amount of assets that ultimately reach the grandchildren.By using a GST, however, the family can transfer assets directly to the grandchildren without incurring estate taxes at the level of the children. The GST can be designed to benefit multiple generations, with the assets being held in the trust and distributed over time. This can help to ensure that the family's wealth is preserved for future generations, while minimizing estate taxes.Additionally, by using a GST, the family can take advantage of the GST tax exemption, which is separate from the gift and estate tax exemptions. For 2023, the GST tax exemption is $12.92 million per person. This means that the family can transfer up to $12.92 million per person to the GST without incurring GST tax.Drawbacks of a GSTWhile generation skipping trusts (GSTs) can be a powerful tool for estate planning, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Here are some examples:1. Complexity: GSTs can be complex legal structures that require careful planning and ongoing management. This can involve significant legal and administrative costs, as well as ongoing tax reporting requirements.2. Loss of Control: Once assets are transferred to a GST, the grantor no longer has control over those assets. This can be a disadvantage for individuals who want to retain some control over their assets, or who are concerned about how the assets will be managed.3. Beneficiary Restrictions: GSTs are subject to certain beneficiary restrictions, which can limit the flexibility of the trust. For example, the trust may be required to distribute assets to certain beneficiaries within a certain timeframe, or may be prohibited from making distributions to certain beneficiaries.4. Tax Implications: While GSTs can be used to minimize estate taxes, they can also have other tax implications. For example, distributions from a GST may be subject to income taxes, and the trust may be subject to annual GST taxes on its assets.GST Tax exemptionThe GST tax exemption is a federal tax exemption that applies to generation skipping transfers. The GST tax is a separate tax from estate and gift taxes and is designed to ensure that wealth is not transferred tax-free through multiple generations. The GST tax exemption is the amount of money or property that can be transferred tax-free through a generation skipping transfer.A child's generation is skipped to avoid an inheritance being subject to estate taxes twice—once when it moves from the grandparents to their children, and then from those children to their children. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) has therefore applied an additional tax to these inheritances since 1976, which was repealed and reinstated as a flat tax in 1986. It only applies to generation-skipping transfers made on or after that date.The generation-skipping tax also covers "skip people." These are gift recipients who are at least 37-1/2 years younger than the gift giver.For 2023, the GST tax exemption is $12.92 million per person. This means that an individual can transfer up to $12.92 million to a trust that benefits grandchildren or great-grandchildren without incurring GST tax. Married couples can combine their GST tax exemptions to transfer up to $25.84 million tax-free.Direct skips in excess of the annual exclusion are to be reported on IRS Form 709, the U.S. Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return. They're entered in Part II of Schedule A. If you enter them on Schedule C of Form 709 as well, they're direct skips, and they're tallied up over the years to be applied against the lifetime exemption. Part III of Schedule A records indirect skips. It is important to note that the GST tax exemption is subject to change, and may be adjusted in the future based on changes in tax laws and regulations.
