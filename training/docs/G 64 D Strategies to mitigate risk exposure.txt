G.64D. Strategies to mitigate risk exposureIt is necessary that the trusts or investment assets within said trusts are setup to lead to financial stability, withstand longevity risk, and also provide for the beneficiary. A common method we all likely have heard of is diversification. But what is the best method of doing such? How can I calculate and best diversify? How can I model growth and market dynamics?Diversification is an investment strategy that involves spreading investments across different asset classes and sectors in order to reduce risk. The goal of diversification is to avoid having all of the investor's eggs in one basket, so to speak. In the context of special needs or family trusts, diversification can be used to reduce the risk of loss and generate returns over the long term. The trustee can invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes in order to achieve a balance between risk and return that meets the needs of the beneficiary.The topic of diversification is a complex one in which many courses can be taught, overviewing topics of modern portfolio theory, FAMA French Carhart models, optimizing skewness and kurtosis, etc. But generally, a mix between asset classes to spread out risk, not just percentages is ideal. Ex: Just because you have 10% more bonds than a portfolio with 100% stock, doesn’t necessarily mean you are taking 10% less risk. It is key you measure the risk levels of each of your assets with a couple of metrics. Here are a few basic diversification strategies to get someone started in relation to estate planning:Bond Laddering (lower interest rate risk)Bond laddering is an investment strategy that involves investing in a series of bonds that mature at different times. The goal of bond laddering is to provide a steady stream of income while minimizing interest rate risk. By investing in bonds that mature at different times, the investor is able to reinvest the proceeds from maturing bonds at prevailing interest rates. 1. Ex: Decide on the length of the ladder and number of rungs (bonds) you want. For example, you might choose a 5-year ladder with 5 bonds.2. Buy bonds that mature in evenly spaced intervals. So for a 5-year ladder, you would buy bonds maturing in 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years. Let’s assume $50,000 here. You have $50,000 to invest in bonds.You decide to buy bonds maturing in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.You allocate $10,000 to each bond, so you buy:1. A 1-year bond with $10,000 face value2. A 2-year bond with $10,000 face value3. A 3-year bond with $10,000 face value4. A 4-year bond with $10,000 face value5. A 5-year bond with $10,000 face value3. Once the shortest-term bond matures, reinvest the proceeds into a new 5-year bond. This keeps the ladder going and maintains the steady maturity schedule.4. Repeat step 3 each time shorter-term bonds mature. This allows you to take advantage of higher interest rates when reinvesting, and ensures you always have bonds maturing to provide you access to your funds.While bond laddering helps lower interest rate and other risks, there are still some risks prevalent:1. Interest Rate Risk: Bond laddering is still subject to interest rate risk albeit less than bonds of all similar maturity. This the risk that interest rates will rise and the value of existing bonds will decline. This can be mitigated by investing in bonds with staggered maturities, so that the investor can take advantage of rising interest rates when bonds mature.2. Market Risk: Diversification does not completely eliminate market risk, which is the risk that the overall market will decline and the value of an investor's portfolio will decline along with it. This can be mitigated by investing in a mix of asset classes and sectors, so that the investor is not overly exposed to any one sector or asset class.3. Credit Risk: Both bond laddering and diversification involve investing in a mix of bonds and other securities, which still exposes the investor to credit risk. Credit risk is the risk that a bond issuer will default on its obligations, resulting in a decline in the value of the bond. This can be mitigated by investing in bonds with high credit ratings and by diversifying across different issuers. With higher credit ratings however, can generally lead to lower yields. 4. Liquidity Risk: Bond laddering involves investing in bonds that mature at different times, which can create liquidity risk. This is the risk that an investor may need to sell a bond before it matures, and may not be able to do so at a favorable price. This can be mitigated by investing in bonds that are traded on a liquid market, and by maintaining a cash reserve to cover unexpected expenses.Modern Portfolio Theory and basic diversificationModern portfolio theory (MPT) is a framework for managing investment risk and return. The core ideas of MPT are:1. Diversification: Invest in a variety of assets that don't react the same way to market events. This reduces risk.2. Portfolio optimization: Choose the right mix of assets based on their risk vs. return characteristics to achieve the maximum return for a given level of risk.3. Risk and return: Riskier assets have higher expected returns, so portfolios must balance risk and return. Increased returns require taking more risk.Mean variance optimization is an investment strategy that seeks to maximize returns while minimizing risk by constructing a portfolio that achieves the highest possible return for a given level of risk. The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return that takes into account both the return and the risk of an investment.To maximize mean variance optimization and the Sharpe ratio, a globally diversified portfolio can be constructed using a combination of domestic and international stocks, bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). This can be achieved through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in a mix of asset classes and sectors.For example, a portfolio might consist of 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10% REITs, with a mix of domestic and international holdings. Within the stock portion of the portfolio, a mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks can be used to diversify across different market sectors and industries. Within the bond portion of the portfolio, a mix of government and corporate bonds can be used to diversify across different credit ratings and maturities.To do the rebalancing is a quantitative framework and continuous math is involved, taking into account historical volatility of each position. Here's a basic example of an equation for mean-variance optimization:Maximize: E(R) = w1E(R1) + w2E(R2) + ...Subject to: Variance = w1^2Var(R1) + w2^2Var(R2) + 2w1w2*Cov(R1,R2) + ...1 = w1 + w2 + ...(other constraints)In this equation:* E(R) is the expected return of the portfolio* E(R1), E(R2), etc. are the expected returns of the individual assets* w1, w2, etc. are the weights (allocations) of the assets in the portfolio* Variance is the variance of the portfolio (risk)* Var(R1), Var(R2), etc. are the variances (risks) of the individual assets* Cov(R1,R2) is the covariance between the returns of assets 1 and 2The goal is to maximize expected return (left side) while constrained by the variance and other limits (right side). The w variables are adjusted to find the maximum E(R) for a given variance (or minimum variance for a given E(R)). This is the core equation behind mean-variance optimization and efficient frontier analysis. The hard part is estimating the input variables from historical data or models. But this equation shows how portfolio return and risk depends on the expected returns, variances, and correlations of the individual assets and their weights in the portfolio.ere is an example equation for mean variance optimization using the positions AAPL, IBM, GE, and F as an example for the contents of the portfolio:Assume that the expected returns, standard deviations, and correlations of these positions are as follows:StockExpected ReturnStandard DeviationAAPL0.100.20IBM0.080.15GE0.060.10F0.040.05AAPLIBMGEFAAPL10.60.40.2IBM0.610.50.3GE0.40.510.1F0.20.30.11The mean variance optimization equation is:Minimize: w' * sigma * wSubject to: w' * r >= r_minw' * e = 1Where:* w is a vector of weights for each stock in the portfolio* sigma is the covariance matrix of the stocks* r is a vector of expected returns for each stock* e is a vector of ones* r_min is the minimum desired return for the portfolioUsing the data above, the equation for mean variance optimization using the positions AAPL, IBM, GE, and F as an example for the contents of the portfolio would be:Minimize: 0.2w1^2 + 0.09w2^2 + 0.01w3^2 + 0.0025w4^2 + 0.18w1w2 + 0.03w1w3 + 0.01w1w4 + 0.075w2w3 + 0.015w2w4 + 0.005w3w4Subject to: 0.10w1 + 0.08w2 + 0.06w3 + 0.04w4 >= r_minw1 + w2 + w3 + w4 = 1In this example, w1, w2, w3, and w4 represent the weights for AAPL, IBM, GE, and F, respectively. The covariance matrix for the stocks is represented by the coefficients of the quadratic terms (0.2, 0.09, 0.01, and 0.0025), and the cross-terms (0.18, 0.03, 0.01, 0.075, 0.015, and 0.005) represent the correlations between the stocks.The objective of the optimization is to minimize the variance of the portfolio, subject to the constraints that the portfolio must achieve a minimum return and that the weights for the stocks must add up to 1. The solution to the optimization problem will provide the optimal weights for each stock in the portfolio.The final weightings for the AAPL, IBM, GE, and F positions in the portfolio would depend on the minimum desired return (r_min) and the specific solution to the optimization problem.Assuming a minimum desired return of 0.06 (or 6%), the solution to the optimization problem is:w1 = 0.478w2 = 0.266w3 = 0.133w4 = 0.123This means that the portfolio should be divided into the following weightings:* 47.8% in AAPL* 26.6% in IBM* 13.3% in GE* 12.3% in FThese weightings reflect the optimal allocation of the positions in the portfolio that will achieve the minimum desired return while minimizing the variance of the portfolio. Keep in mind that these weightings are based on the assumptions made about the expected returns, standard deviations, and correlations of the positions in the portfolio, and may change depending on different assumptions or market conditions.This example is obviously an overly simplistic version of calculating the mean variance optimization and in practice has limited uses, but gives an example of a way to measure and adjust a portfolio based on risk. To allocate and create your portfolio, this is a great place to start and it’s great to learn, but it’s sometimes best to talk to a professional financial advisor to assist with portfolio allocation and learn their methods for creating a diversified investment portfolio. Monte Carlo MethodsMonte Carlo methods can be used to estimate returns and growth for a diversified portfolio. Monte Carlo methods are a type of simulation that involves running a large number of random trials to estimate the probability of different outcomes.In the context of a diversified portfolio, Monte Carlo methods can be used to estimate the potential returns and growth of the portfolio over time. This involves simulating the performance of the portfolio under different market conditions and assumptions, such as varying rates of return, inflation, and interest rates.To use Monte Carlo methods to estimate returns and growth for a diversified portfolio, the following steps can be taken:1. Develop a model: A model is developed that simulates the performance of the portfolio under different market conditions and assumptions. This can involve using historical market data or developing a model based on projected future market conditions.2. Run simulations: The model is run many times using randomly generated inputs to simulate different market conditions and assumptions. For example, the model might be run 10,000 times using different rates of return, inflation rates, and interest rates.3. Analyze results: The results of the simulations are analyzed to estimate the probability of different outcomes. For example, the analysis might show that there is a 90% probability that the portfolio will achieve a certain level of return over a given time period.4. Refine the model: The model is refined based on the results of the simulations and new data or assumptions. This process is iterative and continues until the model produces results that are consistent with historical performance or other benchmarks.
