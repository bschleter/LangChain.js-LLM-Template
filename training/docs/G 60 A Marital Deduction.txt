G.60A. Marital DeductionThe marital deduction is a federal estate tax deduction that allows an individual to transfer/gift an unlimited amount of assets to their spouse tax-free. This can be during the lifetime or after death if specified in a will. The marital deduction is available to U.S. Citizens. Non U.S. citizens do not qualify. However a U.S. citizen can gift the lifetime exemption amount of $12.92 million in 2023 to a non-citizen spouse. To the extent that a gift to a noncitizen spouse in any given year exceeds the annual gift tax exclusion ($17,000 in 2023), it will diminish the citizen spouse’s lifetime applicable exemption amount. In terms of estate planning, the marital deduction can be a useful tool for transferring assets to a spouse while minimizing estate taxes. For example, if one spouse has significant assets and wants to transfer those assets to their surviving spouse, they can use the marital deduction to do so without incurring estate taxes. This can help to ensure that the surviving spouse is provided for financially and can help to simplify the estate planning process.It is important to note that the marital deduction is not a complete exemption from estate taxes. When the surviving spouse dies, the assets they inherit will be subject to estate taxes at that time. Additionally, if the surviving spouse is not a U.S. citizen, there may be certain limitations on the use of the marital deduction. In this case, a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) may be used to provide similar tax benefits.Overall, the appropriate use of the marital deduction will depend on an individual's specific needs and goals. It is important to work with a financial planner or estate planning attorney who has experience in this area to determine how the marital deduction can be used effectively in your estate planning strategy, taking into account factors such as the size of your estate, the needs of your surviving spouse, and any relevant tax laws and regulations.Marital Deduction Example:Let's say that John and Tammy are a married couple who are both U.S. citizens. John has assets worth $15 million in his estate and dies in 2023. Because his assets are above the estate tax level, he would normally owe estate taxes on the amount above the estate tax exemption, which is $12.92 million in 2023. This means that John's estate would owe estate taxes on $2.08 million ($15 million - $12.92 million) at a rate of 40%, which comes out to $832,000 in estate taxes. However, because Tammy can claim the marital deduction, an unlimited amount can pass on to Tammy during their lifetimes. Tammy inherits all of John's assets and can dictate how to use. Five years later, in 2028, Tammy’s assets have grown to $30 million. Because her assets are still above the estate tax level, her estate will owe estate taxes on the amount above the exemption for her, which is $12.92 million based on 2023 numbers. This means that Jane's estate will owe estate taxes on $17.08 million ($30 million - $12.92 million) at a rate of 40%, which comes out to $6.832 million in estate taxes.Overall, the taxes owed on John's estate were minimized by using the marital deduction to transfer assets to Jane tax-free. However, because Jane's assets have grown over time, her estate will owe significant estate taxes when she passes away. It is important to work with a financial planner or estate planning attorney to develop a strategy that takes into account potential tax liabilities over time and helps to minimize those liabilities as much as possible.Property interests passing to a surviving spouse that are not included in the decedent’s gross estate do not qualify for the marital deduction. Expenses, indebtedness, taxes, and losses chargeable against property passing to the surviving spouse will reduce the marital deduction.Non U.S Citizen spousesNon U.S. Citizens do not qualify for the marital estate tax deduction. As such, they would be subject to estate tax if their assets are above the estate tax level. Under U.S. tax law, non-U.S. citizen spouses are not eligible to use the unlimited marital deduction, which allows U.S. citizens to transfer an unlimited amount of assets to their spouse tax-free. Instead, non-U.S. citizen spouses are subject to certain limitations on the amount of assets they can inherit tax-free.To address this issue, non-U.S. citizen spouses can use a QDOT to receive assets from their U.S. citizen spouse tax-free, up to certain limits. A QDOT is a type of trust that is designed to hold assets for the benefit of the non-U.S. citizen spouse, while also meeting certain requirements under U.S. tax law.    The key benefit of a QDOT is that it allows the non-U.S. citizen spouse to defer estate taxes until the assets are distributed from the trust. This can be useful for individuals who have significant assets and want to ensure that their non-U.S. citizen spouse is provided for financially, while also minimizing estate taxes.To qualify as a QDOT, the trust must meet several requirements, including:1. The trustee of the QDOT must be a U.S. citizen or a U.S. bank.2. At least one trustee of the QDOT must be a U.S. bank or other financial institution that is authorized to act as a fiduciary under U.S. law.3. The QDOT must meet certain distribution requirements, including a requirement that at least one trustee of the QDOT is a U.S. citizen or U.S. bank and has the power to withhold estate taxes from distributions to the non-U.S. citizen spouse.4. The QDOT must meet certain reporting requirements, including an annual reporting requirement to the IRS.
