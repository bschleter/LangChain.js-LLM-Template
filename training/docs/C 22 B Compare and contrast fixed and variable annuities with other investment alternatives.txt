Compare and contrast annuities fixed and variable with other investment alternatives. Fixed annuities and variable annuities are two types of annuities that have some key differences and similarities.Differences:1. Investment options: The main difference between fixed and variable annuities is the investment options. Fixed annuities offer a guaranteed interest rate for a set period of time, while variable annuities allow you to invest in a range of funds or sub-accounts, similar to a mutual fund. Some fixed annuities allow the rate of growth to be linked to an investment index with a cap on returns, but also a floor for loss. The returns on variable annuities are not guaranteed and can fluctuate based on market performance.2. Risk: Fixed annuities are considered to be less risky than variable annuities because the returns are guaranteed or at least protected from a loss if the company offering is in good standing. Variable annuities have the potential for higher returns but also come with higher risk due to their exposure to market fluctuations.3. Fees: Variable annuities are generally more expensive than fixed annuities due to the investment management fees on the funds in which it invests in and other charges. Fixed annuities typically have lower fees, but still have higher fees than normal investment accounts generally in order to guarantee the company against a loss. Similarities:1. Tax-deferral: Both fixed and variable annuities provide tax-deferred growth, meaning that you don't have to pay taxes on the gains until you start taking withdrawals.2. Guaranteed income: Both fixed and variable annuities can be structured to provide a guaranteed stream of income in retirement.3. Death benefits: Both types of annuities typically include a death benefit, which provides a payout to your beneficiaries in the event of your death.Overall, the main difference between fixed and variable annuities is the investment options and risk. Fixed annuities can offer a guaranteed interest rate, while variable annuities offer the potential for higher returns but come with higher risk and slightly higher fees with the fund management fees. Both can be similar in fees if they have similar riders, or one has more annuity riders than the other which can increase costs. Both fixed and variable annuities can be structured as either single or joint annuities.A single annuity is a contract between the annuity owner and the insurance company, where the payments are made only to the annuity owner. This type of annuity is typically used by individuals who want a guaranteed stream of income in retirement and don't need to provide for a spouse or beneficiary.A joint annuity, on the other hand, is a contract between the annuity owner and the insurance company, where the payments are made to both the annuity owner and another person, usually a spouse. Joint annuities can be structured in different ways, such as providing payments for the lifetime of both individuals, or for the lifetime of the last surviving individual.Joint annuities can be useful for couples who want to ensure that both spouses have a guaranteed stream of income in retirement, regardless of how long they live. However, it's important to carefully consider the terms and conditions of the annuity, as joint annuities may provide lower payments than single annuities due to the longer life expectancy of two individuals.
