C.23A. Underwriting factors common in life insuranceCommon factors to underwriting in life insurance: * Age - Older applicants generally face higher life insurance premiums due to shorter life expectancy* Health conditions - Pre-existing health conditions like heart disease or cancer can impact premiums or even eligibility for coverage. Certain companies accept certain health risks, and this varies depending on the company. * Lifestyle factors - Things like smoking, alcohol or drug use, risky hobbies or occupation can impact premiums due to increased risk. Again the type of risk that an insurance company weighs heavier or not depends on the company. * Build and weight - Body Mass Index is commonly used to assess risk based on an applicant's build and weight* Family medical history - Genetic or hereditary conditions in immediate family members may be considered when evaluating risk and pricing a policy.Family medical history can affect life insurance premiums because it provides insurers with information about potential risks for hereditary illnesses or conditions that may impact a person's life expectancy. If an individual's family has a history of certain medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, the insurer may consider them to be at a higher risk for developing these same conditions. As a result, the insurer may charge higher premiums to compensate for the increased risk.It's worth noting that not all insurance companies place the same level of emphasis on family medical history, and the impact on premiums can vary depending on the insurer. Additionally, some insurers may require applicants to undergo medical exams or genetic testing to determine their risk level more accurately. Ultimately, family medical history is just one of many factors that insurers consider when determining life insurance premiums, and the impact it has on premiums will depend on the individual's specific situation and the policies of the insurer.
