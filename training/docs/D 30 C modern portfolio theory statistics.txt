D.30C Modern portfolio theory statistics Some key Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) statistics you can calculate include:* Expected return: The weighted average return of the securities/portfolio based on their allocations. Estimated using historical returns or forward-looking estimates.* Volatility (standard deviation): Measures the variability of returns. Calculated from historical return data. Higher volatility means more risk.* Correlation: Measures how securities/portfolios move in relation to each other. Calculated from historical return data. Lower correlation means more diversification benefit.* Sharpe ratio: Measures risk-adjusted return. Calculated as (expected return - risk-free rate) / volatility. Higher Sharpe means higher return per unit of risk.* Beta: Measures a security's sensitivity to market movement. Calculated using regression analysis of security returns vs. market returns. Higher beta means more market risk.The calculations require historical return data and assumptions about forward-looking estimates. The results should be interpreted with the limitations of the assumptions and data in mind.Some ways to use Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimize your portfolio include:* Calculate the expected return and volatility of different portfolio allocations to identify the efficient frontier - the optimal risk-return combinations. Choose an allocation that meets your risk-return goals.* Use correlation analysis to identify asset classes/securities with low correlation to diversify your portfolio. Lower correlation means more risk reduction for the same return.* Calculate the Sharpe ratio of different allocations to maximize the return per unit of risk in your portfolio. The allocation with the highest Sharpe ratio is the most optimal.* Ensure your portfolio allocation has a beta that matches your desired market risk exposure. If you want to be market neutral, choose a beta close to zero. If you want to match market returns, choose a beta close to one.
