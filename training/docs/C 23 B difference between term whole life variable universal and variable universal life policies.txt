C.23B. Term, whole life, variable, universal, and variable universal life. Select most appropriate based on circumstances.  Term Life Insurance:Term life insurance is the most basic type of life insurance. It provides coverage for a specific period of time, typically between 5 and 30 years. If the policyholder passes away during the term of the policy, the death benefit is paid out to the beneficiaries. If the policyholder outlives the term, the policy expires and no benefits are paid out. Term life insurance tends to be the most affordable option and is a good choice for those looking for temporary coverage for a specific period of time.Whole Life Insurance:Whole life insurance provides coverage for the policyholder's entire life, as long as the premiums are paid. It also includes a savings component, known as cash value, that grows over time and can be borrowed against or withdrawn. Whole life insurance tends to be more expensive than term life insurance, but it provides permanent coverage and can accumulate cash value over time.Variable Life Insurance:Variable life insurance is a type of whole life insurance that allows policyholders to invest their premiums in various investment options, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The cash value of the policy can increase or decrease based on the performance of these investments. This type of policy is riskier than traditional whole life insurance because the investment returns are not guaranteed.Universal Life Insurance:Universal life insurance is a permanent life insurance that also includes a savings component. The policyholder can adjust the premium payments and death benefit over time, allowing for more flexibility than traditional whole life insurance. The savings component earns interest at a rate set by the insurer, and policyholders can borrow against or withdraw from the cash value of the policy. Universal life insurance tends to be more expensive than term life insurance but less expensive than whole life insurance.Variable Universal Life Insurance:Variable universal life insurance combines the investment options of variable life insurance with the flexibility of universal life insurance. Policyholders can adjust the premium payments and death benefit over time, and they can also invest their premiums in various investment options. The cash value of the policy can increase or decrease based on the performance of these investments. However, this type of policy is riskier than traditional whole life insurance because both the investment returns and the death benefit are not guaranteed.In summary, term life insurance provides temporary coverage for a specific period of time, while whole life insurance provides permanent coverage with a savings component. Variable life insurance allows policyholders to invest their premiums in various investment options, while universal life insurance offers more flexibility than whole life insurance. Lastly, variable universal life insurance combines the investment options of variable life insurance with the flexibility of universal life insurance.How to select right insurance for a client:The type of life insurance that I would recommend for someone in their 30s depends on their individual needs and goals. Here are a few factors to consider when choosing a policy:* Coverage needs: If the individual has dependents or debts that would need to be paid off in the event of their death, they may want to consider a policy with a higher death benefit. Term life insurance can be a good option in this case, as it provides affordable coverage for a specific period of time.* Savings goals: If the individual is interested in accumulating savings over time, they may want to consider a whole life insurance policy, which includes a savings component that can grow over time. However, it's worth noting that whole life insurance tends to be a lot more expensive than term life insurance, and while there is ‘growth’ within the policy cash value, it takes a few years for that growth to get to an actual return as the insurance company has to hedge their risk of premature death because they are guaranteeing a payout of the policy as long as you continue premium payments. Further, the growth within many whole life policies is typically less than what you’d get within bonds, or equities. Lastly, while there is a cash value and savings growth component in whole life or other permanent life insurance policies, the cash value isn’t as accessible in terms of without a cost. Withdrawing from a life insurance policy cash value is called a ‘loan’ and must be paid back, with interest if the policyholder doesn’t pay back within the premium year. In summation: When a policyholder takes out a loan from their policy's cash value, the insurer uses the cash value as collateral for the loan. The policyholder is essentially borrowing money from the insurer, with the understanding that the loan will be repaid with interest. The loan amount is typically capped at the policy's cash surrender value, which is the amount of cash value that the policyholder would receive if they were to surrender the policy. This is typically less than the full cash value amount. The interest rate on the loan is set by the insurer and may be fixed or variable, depending on the policy terms.* Investment preferences: If the individual is comfortable taking on more risk for potential of less premiums early in the policy and higher premiums later, they may want to consider a variable or variable universal life insurance policy, which allows policyholders to invest in various investment options. However for many people, they need to ensure they are maximizing their investments outside to receive tax deductions such as their retirement accounts, and investing for liquid growth such as their taxable brokerage accounts before considering variable or variable universal policies. This again is why term is typically preferred for many people. The right insurance for the client can be argued in a multitude of ways, with each argument for a certain life insurance policy for a person holding weight. Generally for most people and especially for someone young and early in their career, 99% of the time Term Insurance is the best option because:* Affordable* Highest amount of coverage per dollar* Allows for adequate amount of coverage to cover lifetime of income* Less likely to under insure* Can have a convertible option if health issues down the line occur. Term insurance is preferable based on the above general outlines, which I can go into more detail. For most people, when they think of life insurance, they think sometimes a few hundred thousand may be enough to cover what they need but in reality this is underinsurance for many people. How long should my term be? 30 years right?Generally I prefer 20 year term insurance policies and there’s a reason why. Sometimes for people a 30 year term policy is better, especially if they feel they will still need insurance into their 50’s or 60’s, and career income growth maybe stagnant, or cannot afford to convert any portion of their term life insurance before 5 years of the end of their term policy. However, I personally prefer 20 year term for many people I work with because when you get a 30 year term, you’re paying the insurance company for an extra 10 years of your life of insurance, in a much more expensive premium age range than the first 20 years you were paying. Further, for many professionals I work with, they don’t need the multiple million(s) of term insurance at the later stages of their career, as they have almost likely self insured, and if they need to, they can convert their term policy usually within the last 5 years at the same rating they got when they were young. This allows them to convert a small portion to a permanent policy that the insurance company allows, keep the same health rating if their health worsened, but be at a more appropriate insurance amount, and even keep for a social security withdraw hedge! Term 20 year insurance example: You obtain a 20-year term policy you get when you are 30, you are paying premiums for the very unlikely scenario that you have a premature death from 30-50. Statistically not likely but a financially dire circumstance if you do. This makes term insurance less expensive than others because for a limited time frame, you purchased while you are young, and the risks are lower for the life insurance company. Now, say you purchased a 30-year term insurance policy at 30. Now the insurance company has to hedge the risk that you may pass away between the ages of 50-60, which statistically more likely several fold. To hedge this, you are now paying for those more expensive years of insurance, simply because you got a 30 year term. This is where I find the 20 year term is the general optimal spot for most people, between balancing the risk of premature death and the lifetime of income losses, and balance of costs. When someone gets a 20 year also, I anticipate that they will have used some of the cost savings of lower price term insurance to invest in their retirement and overall net worth, hence self insuring themselves by those later years. Thus if a premature death happens, it won’t be a financial catastrophe for the beneficiaries as assets are spread to several different taxation classes to provide for them as desired. This method psychologically also creates so financial accountability on the person too by giving them a goal of mostly self insuring by the time their term policy ends. This helps “hold their feet to the fire” to save and save early.  Cash Value Loans:If you withdraw all of the cash value from your whole life insurance policy, the policy would typically be surrendered and terminated. This means that you would no longer be covered by the policy, and you would not be able to borrow against the cash value or receive any further benefits.If you only withdraw a portion of the cash value, the policy may still remain in force, but the amount of the death benefit and the cash value would be reduced. Additionally, any loans against the policy's cash value would need to be repaid with interest.The amount you can withdraw from the cash value in a life insurance policy depends on the specific policy and the amount of cash value that has accumulated over time. The policy's terms and conditions will specify the amount that can be withdrawn, and any applicable fees or penalties.Typically, you can withdraw up to the amount of the policy's cash surrender value without incurring taxes. The cash surrender value is the amount of cash value that you would receive if you were to surrender the policy. However, if you withdraw more than the amount of the cash surrender value, the excess amount may be subject to taxes.Before making any decisions about withdrawing cash value from your policy, it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or insurance professional to fully understand the potential impact on your policy and your finances, including any tax implications.It's important to note that withdrawing cash value from a whole life insurance policy can have tax implications. If the amount of the withdrawal exceeds the premiums you have paid into the policy, the excess amount may be subject to taxes. Additionally, if the policy is surrendered or lapses, any gains on the policy may be subject to taxes as well. If the policy is a non-qualified policy (i.e., not used for business purposes), any withdrawals that exceed the premiums paid into the policy may be subject to taxes on the gains. Additionally, if the policy is surrendered or lapses, any gains on the policy may be subject to taxes as well.Cash Value withdrawal example:You have a life insurance policy with a $250,000 death benefit, you have paid 19 years of premium payments, it has a cash value of $40,000, and you make a withdrawal of $20,000 that is not paid back. It has a cash surrender value of $22,000. You continue your premium payment of $1,800/year. In this example we assume 19 years of 1,800/payments, so the total premiums paid in are $34,200. If you make a withdrawal of $20,000 from your whole life insurance policy and do not pay it back within a year, there are several things to note here:1. Your death benefit will be reduced unless paid back in. The death benefit is typically reduced by the amount of the withdrawal, which in this case would be $20,000. So, your beneficiaries would receive $230,000 ($250,000 - $20,000) upon your death.2. Your cash value will be reduced and loan interest will be applied to it. The cash value of your policy is typically reduced by the amount of the withdrawal, which in this case would be $20,000. So, your cash value would be reduced to $20,000 ($40,000 - $20,000).3. In this scenario you won’t pay any taxes because the withdrawal is less than the total premiums paid in ($34,200 of premiums, and a $20,000 withdrawal). If the withdrawal would have been is greater than the total premiums you have paid into the policy, then the portion of the withdrawal that exceeds your premiums may be subject to income tax. 4. Your policy may lapse if you don’t continue premium payments. If you do not pay back the withdrawal within a year, your policy may lapse if the remaining cash value and the premiums are not sufficient to cover the cost of insurance. Usually though if you withdraw less than the surrender value on a whole life policy, if you keep making premium payments the policy will stay in force. This however isn’t always the case with a universal life or variable universal life policy.  Policy LoansAssume you have a whole life insurance policy with a cash value of $50,000 and a death benefit of $250,000. You have paid premiums for 10 years and have accumulated a cash value of $50,000. You need to borrow $10,000 for a home renovation project, and you do not want to withdraw the cash value from your policy.You decide to take out a policy loan against your cash value. The insurance company agrees to lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%. The loan agreement specifies that interest will be charged on the outstanding balance of the loan and will be added to the loan balance each year.After one year, the outstanding loan balance is $10,500 ($10,000 loan + $500 interest). The cash value of your policy is $45,000 ($50,000 cash value - $5,000 loan balance). The death benefit of your policy is still $250,000.After five years, the outstanding loan balance is $12,762 ($10,000 loan + $2,762 interest). The cash value of your policy is $37,238 ($50,000 cash value - $12,762 loan balance). The death benefit of your policy is still $250,000.If you were to pass away at this point, your beneficiaries would receive the death benefit of $250,000 minus the outstanding loan balance of $12,762, which would be $237,238. If you were to repay the loan before you pass away, the cash value of your policy would be restored to its original amount, and the death benefit would remain at $250,000.
