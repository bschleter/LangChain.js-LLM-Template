G. 58B. Need for estate liquidity Developing a cash flow plan for maintaining a client's estate from the date of death to final distribution, including the payment of tax liabilities, requires a thorough understanding of the estate's assets, liabilities, and distribution plan. Here are some steps to create a cash flow plan for an estate:1. Assess the estate's assets and liabilities: The first step is to review the estate plan and assess the assets and liabilities of the estate. This includes reviewing the will, trusts, and any other estate planning documents to understand the assets and liabilities of the estate. Some assets are potentially illiquid, may require alternate valuations, and may be things such as closely held businesses. 2. Identify sources of income: Next, identify any sources of income that the estate may have, such as rental income, dividends, or interest income. This will help to determine the regular cash flow that the estate can expect.3. Estimate expenses: Estimate the expenses that the estate will incur during the administration period, including funeral expenses, estate administration fees, taxes, and other expenses. This will help to determine the monthly or annual cash outflows that the estate can expect.4. Determine tax liabilities: Determine the estate's tax liabilities, including estate taxes and income taxes. This will help to determine the amount of cash needed to pay the taxes and the timing of the payments.5. Develop a cash flow plan: Based on the assessment of assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and tax liabilities, develop a cash flow plan that outlines the estimated cash inflows and outflows for the estate. The plan should include an estimate of the amount of cash needed each month or year to maintain the estate and pay any taxes owed.6. Monitor and adjust the plan: Estate cash flow needs can change over time, so it's important to monitor the estate and adjust the cash flow plan as needed to ensure that there is enough cash to maintain the estate and pay any taxes owed.Overall, developing a cash flow plan for maintaining an estate requires a thorough understanding of the estate's assets, liabilities, and distribution plan, as well as an assessment of the estate's income, expenses, and tax liabilities. Financial professionals should work closely with the estate's executor or trustee to develop a plan that meets the estate's obligations and ensures that assets are distributed according to the wishes of the deceased.During the administration period, an estate may incur a variety of expenses, including:1. Funeral and burial expenses: These can include expenses such as funeral home fees, cemetery fees, and the cost of a casket or urn.2. Estate administration fees: These fees may include legal fees, accounting fees, and fees charged by the executor or trustee for their services.3. Estate taxes: Depending on the size of the estate, federal and/or state estate taxes may be owed.4. Income taxes: The estate may owe income taxes on any income earned after the date of death, such as interest or rental income.5. Property maintenance and repair expenses: If the estate includes real estate or other property, there may be expenses for maintaining and repairing the property.6. Debts and obligations: The estate may have outstanding debts and obligations that need to be paid, such as credit card balances, mortgages, or other loans.7. Insurance premiums: If the estate owns life insurance policies, there may be premiums that need to be paid to keep the policies in force.8. Miscellaneous expenses: Other expenses that the estate may incur include storage fees for personal property, appraisal fees, and costs associated with the sale of assets.It's important to note that the specific expenses that an estate may incur depend on the size and complexity of the estate, as well as the terms of the estate plan. Executors and trustees should work closely with financial professionals and legal advisors to ensure that all expenses are properly identified and paid during the administration period.There are some common mistakes that financial professionals should avoid when developing such a plan. Here are some examples:1. Failing to conduct a thorough inventory of the estate: Without a complete inventory of the estate, it is difficult to determine the liquidity needs of the estate. It is important to identify all assets and liabilities, including real estate, investments, bank accounts, debts, and taxes.2. Overlooking potential liquidity needs: Failing to consider potential liquidity needs can result in the estate being unable to meet its obligations. This includes expenses such as funeral expenses, outstanding debts, and taxes.3. Not considering the needs of beneficiaries: It is important to consider the needs of the beneficiaries and whether they will require access to funds in the short term. This may include education expenses, health care costs, and other needs.4. Not reviewing the estate plan: The estate plan should be reviewed to determine if there are any provisions for liquidity, such as a trust or life insurance policy. Failing to review the estate plan can result in missed opportunities to plan for liquidity.5. Failing to develop a comprehensive plan: A comprehensive plan should be developed to meet the liquidity needs of the estate. This may involve selling assets, taking out a loan, or using life insurance proceeds. Failing to develop a comprehensive plan can result in the estate being unable to meet its obligations.6. Not monitoring the plan: The plan should be monitored regularly to ensure that it is meeting the liquidity needs of the estate. Adjustments may need to be made as circumstances change.
