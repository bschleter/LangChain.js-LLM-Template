D.30A Statistical measures such as standard deviation t statistic, correlation, r^2, skewness and kurtosisMean (average):* Sum up all the values and divide by the number of values.* The mean represents the central tendency of the data. A higher mean implies higher total returns or values.Standard deviation:* Calculate the difference between each value and the mean.* Square each difference and sum them up.* Divide the sum by the number of values.* Take the square root.* The standard deviation measures the dispersion or variability of the data around the mean. A higher standard deviation implies more risk or uncertainty.T-statistic:* Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the data.* Subtract a reference value (e.g. a comparison mean) from the mean.* Divide the result by the standard deviation.* The t-statistic indicates if the mean of the data is significantly different from the reference value at a given confidence level. A higher absolute t-statistic means more significant difference.Correlation:* Calculate the covariance between two variables by summing the product of their deviations from the mean.* Divide the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables.* The correlation ranges from -1 to 1. A higher absolute value means a stronger linear relationship (positive or negative) between the variables. 0 means no relationship.R-squared:* Calculate the correlation between the variables as above.* Square the correlation coefficient.* R-squared indicates the percentage of variability in one variable that is explained by the other variable. A higher R-squared means the variables are more correlated.Skewness:* Calculate a normalized measure of the asymmetry of the data distribution around the mean.* Positive skewness means the distribution has a longer right tail. Negative skewness means the left tail is longer.* Skewness indicates the likelihood/magnitude of extreme deviations from the mean.Kurtosis:* Calculate a normalized measure of the tailedness of the data distribution.* Higher kurtosis means a more peaked distribution with fatter tails, indicating a higher likelihood/magnitude of extreme deviations from the mean (both high and low).* Lower kurtosis means a more flat distribution with thinner tails.Skewness and kurtosis are two measures that describe the shape of a return distribution:* Skewness measures asymmetry. A positive skewness means the right tail of the distribution is longer, indicating a higher likelihood of extremely high positive returns. Negative skewness means the left tail is longer, indicating a higher likelihood of extremely low returns.* Kurtosis measures tailedness. Higher kurtosis means a more peaked distribution with fatter tails, indicating a higher likelihood of both extremely high and low returns. Lower kurtosis means a more flat distribution with thinner tails and less extreme returns.For a normal distribution, skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3. Positive skewness and high kurtosis indicate a distribution with more risk of extreme returns, either high or low. Negative skewness and high kurtosis indicate more downside risk.Analyzing skewness and kurtosis is useful for evaluating the risks in a return distribution and managing extreme risks in an investment portfolio. Non-normal skewness and kurtosis can arise from volatile asset classes, market crashes, etc.The stock market doesn’t follow a normal distribution, hence the importance of understanding the concept of skewness and kurtosis in portfolio returns and risk measurement. Some ways to measure the risk from skewness or kurtosis in an investment include:* Calculate the semi-variance or downside deviation to measure downside risk from negative skewness. This measures the variability of returns below a threshold (e.g. 0% return). Higher semi-variance means more downside risk.* Calculate the value at risk (VaR) to measure the risk of extreme losses from high kurtosis. VaR measures the maximum potential loss within a given confidence level and time period. A higher VaR means a higher risk of extreme losses.* Use stress testing or scenario analysis to assess the impact of extreme but plausible events on the investment. This can reveal risks from both negative skewness and high kurtosis.* Diversify the investment to reduce non-normal risks. Combining investments with different return distributions can offset extreme risks from skewness or kurtosis.* Use hedging strategies like stop-losses or put options to mitigate extreme downside risks.Measuring and mitigating skewness and kurtosis risk requires analyzing the return distribution and understanding the behavior of extreme but plausible events. A combination of statistical measures and practical risk management can be used to address these risks in an investment portfolio.Semi-variance is calculated as follows:1. Calculate the mean return of the data set.2. Calculate the difference between each data point and the mean.3. Square each difference.4. Sum up only the negative differences (ignore positive differences).5. Divide the sum by the number of data points.6. Take the square root.The result is the semi-variance, which measures the variability of returns below the mean return. It captures downside risk and can be used as an alternative to standard deviation when returns below a threshold (like 0%) are of more concern.A lower semi-variance is preferable as it means less downside risk. Semi-variance can be used to compare downside risk across different investments or calculate a "downside deviation ratio" - the semi-variance divided by the standard deviation as a measure of downside risk relative to total risk.
