Guardianship provisions: If the testator has minor children, the will should include provisions for their care and guardianship.5. Residuary clause: The will should include a residuary clause, which specifies how any remaining assets should be distributed after specific gifts have been made.6. Signatures: The will should be signed by the testator and witnesses.Trusts:1. Grantor: The trust document should identify the person creating the trust, also known as the grantor.2.

The will appoints an executor, who is responsible for managing the estate and distributing assets to the beneficiaries according to the instructions in the will. The executor will collect and value the assets, pay off any debts and taxes owed by the estate, and distribute the remaining assets to the beneficiaries according to the instructions in the will.Trusts:A trust is a legal arrangement in which a person transfers their assets to a trustee, who manages those assets and distributes them to the beneficiaries according to the instructions in the trust document. The trust can be revocable or irrevocable, and can be used to manage assets during the grantor's lifetime and after their death. Trusts can also provide tax benefits and asset protection for the beneficiaries.
