F.49C Non qualified benefits for business owners and key executivesNon-qualified benefits are a type of employee benefit that is not subject to the same tax rules and restrictions as qualified plans like 401(k)s and IRAs. Here are some examples of non-qualified benefits that are commonly used by business owners and key executives:1. Non-qualified deferred compensation (NQDC): NQDC plans allow executives to defer a portion of their compensation to a future date, typically retirement. The deferred amounts are not subject to income tax until they are paid out, allowing executives to defer taxes and potentially reduce their tax burden in retirement. NQDC plans can be structured in a variety of ways, including salary deferral plans, bonus deferral plans, or supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs).2. Section 162 executive bonus plans: Section 162 executive bonus plans allow employers to provide bonuses to key executives in a tax-efficient manner. Under these plans, the employer pays the premiums for a life insurance policy on the executive's life, and the executive receives the death benefit tax-free. The bonus is deductible to the employer as a business expense, and the executive can use the cash value of the policy to supplement their retirement income.3. Split-dollar life insurance: Split-dollar life insurance is a type of life insurance policy that is jointly owned by the employer and the executive. The employer pays a portion of the premium, which is treated as a loan to the executive. When the policy pays out, the employer receives the portion of the death benefit equal to the premium payments, and the executive receives the remaining amount tax-free.4. Executive stock options: Executive stock options give executives the right to purchase company stock at a predetermined price, typically below the current market price. If the stock price increases, the executive can exercise the option and sell the stock at a profit. Stock options are not subject to income tax until they are exercised, allowing executives to potentially defer taxes and reduce their tax burden.Split-dollar life insurance is a type of life insurance policy that is jointly owned by the employer and the executive. The employer pays a portion of the premium, which is treated as a loan to the executive. When the policy pays out, the employer receives the portion of the death benefit equal to the premium payments, and the executive receives the remaining amount tax-free. The tax implications of split-dollar life insurance can vary based on the structure of the plan and the specific provisions of the policy. Here are some general guidelines:1. Loan-based split-dollar plans: In loan-based split-dollar plans, the employer loans the premium payments to the executive, who is responsible for repaying the loan plus interest to the employer. The interest on the loan is typically at a rate lower than the market rate, which can create a taxable benefit for the executive. The executive must report the imputed interest as income each year, and the employer can deduct the actual interest paid.2. Endorsement split-dollar plans: In endorsement split-dollar plans, the employer pays the premiums and is the sole owner of the policy. The executive has a right to a portion of the death benefit equal to the premiums paid, which is typically paid out as a loan or bonus at retirement. The tax implications of endorsement split-dollar plans can be complex and depend on the specific provisions of the policy.3. Taxation of death benefit: When the policy pays out, the executive receives the remaining amount of the death benefit tax-free. However, if the executive is also a shareholder or owner of the company, the death benefit may be subject to estate tax if the value of the executive's ownership interest in the company exceeds the estate tax exemption limit. Premiums paid by the employer are not taxable to the employee. The cash value and death benefit are taxable to the employee as non-qualified deferred compensation. The taxes are due when the cash value is accessible (e.g. policy loan or withdrawal) or the death benefit is paid out. If the policy is transferred to the employee or cancelled, the employee may have to recognize the taxable compensation at that time, even if the cash value is not accessible or death benefit paid yet. The life insurance benefits are tax-free to the beneficiary if the employee pays income taxes on the value before passing away. Otherwise, the benefits are taxable to the extent of the policy's cash value.4. Deductibility of premiums: The employer can deduct the portion of the premiums paid that corresponds to the employer's share of the death benefit. The executive is not allowed to deduct any of the premiums paid.
