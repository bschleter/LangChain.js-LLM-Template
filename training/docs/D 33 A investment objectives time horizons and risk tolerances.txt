D.33A.   Assist a client in identifying his/her investment objectives, time horizons and risk tolerances.  help a client identify their investment objectives, time horizon and risk tolerance:1. Investment objectives - Ask questions to understand what the client is investing for. Some examples:* Are you investing for retirement? If so, what age do you plan to retire?* Do you have any major financial goals you are saving for? (e.g. buying a house, children's education, etc.)* What is your desired investment return? (e.g. keep up with inflation, achieve a high return, etc.)Understanding the client's investment objectives will help determine an appropriate investment strategy.2. Time horizon - Determine the client's investment time frame. Some questions to ask:* When do you think you will need access to your investment funds?* Does your investment objective have a specific deadline? (e.g. retirement in 10 years, children's college in 5 years, etc.)The time horizon will impact how the investments are allocated between riskier and more stable assets. Longer time horizons allow more risk, shorter time horizons require more stability.3. Risk tolerance - Assess the client's risk appetite and comfort with investment volatility. Some questions to ask:* How concerned are you with fluctuations in your investment value?* If your investments declined in value, what would your reaction be? Would you sell, hold or buy more?* How much variability in returns are you willing to accept to pursue higher long-term returns?Create and investment plan once you have a clear understanding of person’s investment objectives, time horizon, and risk tolerance. This will involve selecting appropriate asset classes for their risk and goals, diversifying their portfolio to mitigate risk, and choosing appropriate investment vehicles to purse these objectives. A client's risk tolerance will determine how aggressively or conservatively their investment portfolio should be invested. Higher risk tolerance allows more volatility, lower risk tolerance requires more stability.By understanding the client's objectives, time horizon and risk tolerance, you can make investment recommendations that align with their needs and preferences. It is an ongoing conversation to ensure the investment strategy continues to match the client's changing circumstances.
