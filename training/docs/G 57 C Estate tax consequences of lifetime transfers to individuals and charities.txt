G. 57C. Identify the estate tax consequences of lifetime transfers to individuals and charitiesReduces the lifetime exemption amount by the amount that you gifted above the annual gift exclusion.       There are several types of estate-based charitable transfers, including:1. Charitable Remainder Annuity Trusts (CRATs): In a CRAT, the donor transfers assets to a trust, which pays a fixed annuity to the donor or other beneficiaries for a specified term. At the end of the term, the remaining assets pass to the designated charity. It is to last lifetime of recipient or for a stated term, If term of years is used, it cannot exceed twenty years. 2. Charitable Remainder Unitrusts (CRUTs): In a CRUT, the donor transfers assets to a trust, which pays a variable annuity to the donor or other beneficiaries for a specified term. At the end of the term, the remaining assets pass to the designated charity.3. Charitable Lead Annuity Trusts (CLATs): In a CLAT, the donor transfers assets to a trust, which pays a fixed annuity to the designated charity for a specified term. At the end of the term, the remaining assets pass to the donor or other beneficiaries.4. Charitable Lead Unitrusts (CLUTs): In a CLUT, the donor transfers assets to a trust, which pays a variable annuity to the designated charity for a specified term. At the end of the term, the remaining assets pass to the donor or other beneficiaries.5. Charitable Gift Annuities: In a charitable gift annuity, the donor transfers assets to a charity in exchange for a fixed annuity payment for life. The charity retains the remainder of the assets upon the donor's death.6. A pooled income fund is another type of estate-based charitable transfer. It is a type of trust that allows donors to pool their assets with other donors, with the income generated from the fund being paid out to the donors or their designated beneficiaries for life.The charity administering the fund invests the assets, and the income generated from those investments is distributed among the donors based on their share of the fund. Upon the death of the last surviving beneficiary, the remaining assets in the fund pass to the charity.Pooled income funds can offer donors several benefits, including immediate tax deductions for their contributions, the ability to receive income for life, and the satisfaction of making a charitable gift. However, they may not be ideal for all donors, as they require a certain level of ongoing management and may have limitations on the types of assets that can be contributed.7. Private foundation A private foundation is another type of charitable entity that can be established by an individual or a family to support charitable causes. Unlike other types of charitable transfers, such as donor-advised funds and charitable trusts, private foundations allow the donor or their family to maintain an ongoing role in the management and distribution of the foundation's assets.Private foundations are typically established as non-profit organizations and must be registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). They are required to distribute at least 5% of their assets each year to qualified charities, and may also engage in other charitable activities, such as making grants and conducting their own charitable programs.While private foundations can offer donors a great deal of control and flexibility in their charitable giving, they also require a significant amount of ongoing management and compliance with federal and state regulations. They may also be subject to certain tax rules and limitations, such as restrictions on self-dealing and excess business holdings.Charitable Remainder Annuity Trusts (CRATs) are not required to make any distributions to charity until the end of the term of the trust, when the remaining assets pass to the designated charity or charities.However, in order for a CRAT to qualify for tax-exempt status, it must meet certain requirements set forth by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). One of these requirements is that the present value of the charitable remainder interest in the trust must be at least 10% of the initial fair market value of the assets placed in the trust. This ensures that a significant portion of the assets will eventually pass to charity. Further, once the trust is established, it must pay out a specific amount of income each year (at least 5%). This remains fixed once the initial payments are calculated. No additions are allowed after established. Additionally, any income earned by the CRAT during the term of the trust is not subject to income tax at the trust level, but is instead passed through to the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are responsible for paying income tax on the distributions they receive from the trust.Charitable Remainder Unitrusts (CRUTs) are a type of charitable trust that allows donors to make a charitable gift while also retaining an income stream from the donated assets. In a CRUT, the donor contributes assets to a trust, which then pays a percentage of the trust's value to the donor or other beneficiaries for a specified term or for the life of the donor.The percentage of the trust's value that is paid out each year is determined at the time the trust is established and remains fixed for the life of the trust. This percentage can be no less than 5% and no more than 50% of the trust's value. The higher the percentage, the greater the income stream to the beneficiary, but the smaller the charitable deduction available to the donor.At the end of the term of the trust, or upon the death of the last surviving beneficiary, the remaining assets in the trust pass to the designated charity or charities. The charity is entitled to receive the present value of the charitable remainder interest in the trust, which is calculated at the time the trust is established.CRUTs offer several benefits to donors, including the ability to receive income for life, a charitable deduction for the value of the remainder interest in the trust, and the satisfaction of making a charitable gift. However, they also require careful planning and management to ensure that the trust is structured in a way that meets the donor's goals and complies with IRS regulations.A Charitable Lead Unitrust (CLUT) is a type of charitable trust that provides income to a designated charity for a specified term, with the remainder passing to non-charitable beneficiaries at the end of the term. In a CLUT, the donor contributes assets to a trust, which then pays a fixed or variable percentage of the trust's value each year to the designated charity.The percentage of the trust's value that is paid out each year is determined at the time the trust is established and can be fixed or variable. A fixed percentage pays the same amount every year, while a variable percentage is based on the value of the trust's assets each year. At the end of the term of the trust, the remaining assets pass to the non-charitable beneficiaries, such as the donor's family or other designated individuals.CLUTs offer several benefits to donors, including the ability to provide income to a designated charity for a specified term, a charitable deduction for the present value of the charitable interest in the trust, and the eventual transfer of assets to non-charitable beneficiaries. However, they require careful planning and management to ensure that the trust is structured in a way that meets the donor's goals and complies with IRS regulations.A Charitable Lead Annuity Trust (CLAT) is a type of charitable trust that provides income to a designated charity for a specified term, with the remainder passing to non-charitable beneficiaries at the end of the term. In a CLAT, the donor contributes assets to a trust, which then pays a fixed annuity amount to the designated charity for the term of the trust.The annuity amount paid to the charity is determined at the time the trust is established and remains fixed for the term of the trust. At the end of the term of the trust, the remaining assets pass to the non-charitable beneficiaries, such as the donor's family or other designated individuals.CLATs offer several benefits to donors, including the ability to provide income to a designated charity for a specified term, a charitable deduction for the present value of the charitable interest in the trust, and the eventual transfer of assets to non-charitable beneficiaries. However, they require careful planning and management to ensure that the trust is structured in a way that meets the donor's goals and complies with IRS regulations.Like a CLUT, a CLAT must meet certain IRS regulations to qualify for tax-exempt status. These regulations include:1. Payout Rate: The CLAT must pay out a fixed annuity amount to the designated charity each year for the term of the trust.2. Term of the Trust: The term of the trust must be for a specific number of years. 3. Reporting: The CLAT must file annual tax returns and other required reports with the IRS.CLATs and CLUTs are best established at death and don’t work well under current tax law while living. The estate can take the then present value of a payment stream as an estate tax deduction. A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a charitable giving vehicle that allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants to qualified charities from the fund over time. It is similar to establishing a private foundation, but doesn’t allow an income stream to the donor or other non-charitable beneficiaries. To establish a DAF, the donor contributes cash or other assets to a sponsoring organization, such as a community foundation or a financial institution, and then recommends grants from the fund to qualified charities. The sponsoring organization invests the assets and manages the grants on behalf of the donor. The donor can make additional contributions to the fund at any time and receive additional tax deductions.DAFs offer several benefits to donors, including the ability to make a charitable contribution and receive an immediate tax deduction, the ability to recommend grants to qualified charities over time, and the ease and convenience of having a single vehicle for all charitable giving.However, it is important to note that the donor does not have legal control over the assets in the DAF once they are contributed to the sponsoring organization. The sponsoring organization has the legal right to determine which charities receive grants from the fund, although they typically follow the donor's recommendations as long as they are to qualified charities.
