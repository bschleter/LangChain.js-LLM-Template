B.15B. Qualifications for financial aid as part of education financial plan1. FAFSA: To qualify for federal financial aid, including the Pell Grant, students must complete the FAFSA. The FAFSA is used to determine a student's eligibility for federal grants, loans, and work-study programs. The FAFSA asks for information about the student's income, assets, and family size, which is used to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC).2. Pell Grant: The Pell Grant is a federal grant program that provides funding to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. To qualify for the Pell Grant, students must meet the following eligibility requirements:* Must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen.* Must be enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an undergraduate program.* Must have a high school diploma or equivalent.* Must demonstrate financial need, as determined by the FAFSA, so you must fill out a FAFSA form.* Must not have already earned a bachelor's or professional degree.3. Pell Grant Amounts: The amount of Pell Grant funding awarded to a student varies depending on the student's financial need, the cost of attendance at their school, and other factors. For the 2023-2024 academic year, the maximum Pell Grant award is $7,395.4. Application Deadlines: The deadline to submit the FAFSA varies depending on the state and school, but it is typically in the spring or early summer before the academic year for which the student is seeking financial aid. It's important to submit the FAFSA as soon as possible to ensure that the student is considered for all available financial aid.5. Renewal: Students must renew their FAFSA each year to continue receiving federal financial aid, including the Pell Grant. The renewal process is similar to the initial application process, but takes less time because much of the information is pre-filled from the previous year's application.TEACH Grant:The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant is a federal grant program that provides funding to students who are planning to become teachers in high-need subject areas in low-income schools. Here's what you need to know about TEACH Grant qualifications:1. Eligibility: To be eligible for the TEACH Grant, students must meet the following requirements:* Must be enrolled in a TEACH Grant-eligible program at a participating institution.* Must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25 (on a 4.0 scale), or score above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test.* Must complete the FAFSA and demonstrate financial need.* Must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen.* Must sign an agreement to serve as a full-time teacher in a high-need subject area in a low-income school for at least four years within eight years of completing the program.2. Amount of Grant: The maximum TEACH Grant award is $4,000 per year, but this amount may be less depending on the student's financial need and other factors.3. Service Obligation: Students who receive the TEACH Grant must complete a service obligation by teaching full-time for at least four years in a high-need subject area in a low-income school. If the student does not complete this service obligation, the TEACH Grant will be converted into a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, which must be repaid with interest.4. Application Process: To apply for the TEACH Grant, students must complete the FAFSA and submit a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve (ATS) each year. The ATS outlines the student's service obligation and must be signed by the student and a school official.
