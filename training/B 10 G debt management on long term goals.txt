B.10G. Effect of debt management on long term goalsLet's say a client has $50,000 in student loan debt with a 6% interest rate, and they want to pay off the debt in 10 years. Their monthly payment is $555.10.Scenario 1: The client pays only the minimum payment of $555.10 per month for 10 years, totaling $66,612 in payments over that time. With interest, they will have paid a total of $74,005, and they will still owe over $20,000 in student loan debt.Scenario 2: The client decides to increase their monthly payment to $700 per month. By doing so, they will pay off their debt in just over 7 years and save over $15,000 in interest charges. Over time, the extra $145.90 per month will add up. If the client invests this amount in a retirement account with a 7% annual rate of return, after 30 years, they will have an additional $122,000 in retirement savings.Scenario 3: The client decides to further increase their monthly payment to $900 per month. By doing so, they will pay off their debt in just over 5 years and save over $23,000 in interest charges. Over time, the extra $344.90 per month will add up. If the client invests this amount in a retirement account with a 7% annual rate of return, after 30 years, they will have an additional $290,000 in retirement savings.As you can see, by making smart debt management decisions and allocating extra money towards debt repayment, clients can save significant amounts of money in interest charges and free up money to put towards other financial goals, such as retirement savings. Over time, these extra savings can grow through compound interest and make a big difference in achieving long term financial goals.
