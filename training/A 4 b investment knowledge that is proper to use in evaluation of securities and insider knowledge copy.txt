A.4B. Investment knowledge that is proper to use in evaluation of securities and insider informationInvestment knowledge that is proper to use in the evaluation of securities refers to information that is available to the public and is obtained through legal means, such as reading financial statements, analyzing market trends, and conducting research on a company's products and services. This type of information is accessible to all investors and can be used to make informed investment decisions.On the other hand, insider information refers to non-public information that is obtained through illegal means, such as through a company insider who has access to confidential information. This could include information about a company's financial performance, upcoming mergers or acquisitions, or other material events that could affect the value of the company's securities. The use of insider information is illegal and constitutes insider trading.The main difference between investment knowledge and insider information is that investment knowledge is available to all investors and can be used to make informed investment decisions, while insider information is non-public and can only be obtained through illegal means. The use of insider information gives an unfair advantage to those who possess it, and undermines the integrity of the financial markets. It is important for investors to conduct their research using only legal means and to avoid using insider information in any form of investment decision-making.No decision should be made without conducting research to affirm a trade conviction. An illegal insider trade does not have to any material benefit to be considered an insider trade.1. Conduct research using only publicly available information: Investors should rely on information that is available to the public, such as financial statements, research reports, and news articles.2. Avoid trading on rumors: Investors should avoid trading on rumors or tips that they receive from unknown sources. Instead, they should verify the information before making any investment decisions. One such example is if someone overheard someone talking about XYZ company buying ABC company at a restaurant. Without research, publicly available info to lead to considerate conviction that this was to occur, and other necessary info, a person must not trade on this information or spread it further where someone else may trade on said information. 3. Do not seek out inside information: Investors should not actively seek out inside information or encourage others to share it with them.4. Avoid trading during blackout periods: Companies typically have blackout periods during which insiders are prohibited from trading in the company's securities. Investors should avoid trading during these periods to avoid any appearance of insider trading.5. Consult with legal counsel: If investors have any doubts about the legality of the information they are using to make investment decisions, they should consult with legal counsel to ensure they are not violating any laws.6. Report suspicious activity: If investors become aware of any suspicious activity or potential insider trading, they should report it to the appropriate regulatory authorities.A good rule of thumb to determine if the information is public or not, is if a regular person outside of an including but not limited to an industry or geographical area could have found or learned of the information. The information in research and trading must be at least be able to be known by the general public. Here are more instances of insider trading:1. Mergers and acquisitions: In the context of mergers and acquisitions, it can be difficult to determine what information is considered insider information. For example, if a company is in the process of acquiring another company, employees of both companies may have access to non-public information about the acquisition. Investors who trade on this information could be accused of insider trading, even if they obtained the information through legal means.2. Government regulations: In industries that are heavily regulated by the government, it can be difficult to determine what information is considered insider information. For example, if a pharmaceutical company is awaiting approval for a new drug from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), employees of the company may have access to non-public information about the approval process. Investors who trade on this information could be accused of insider trading, even if they obtained the information through legal means.3. Company earnings: When a company releases its earnings report, it can be difficult to determine what information is considered insider information. For example, if a company's earnings report is leaked before it is released to the public, investors who trade on this information could be accused of insider trading, even if they obtained the information through legal means.4. Trading by family members: It can be difficult to determine if trading by family members of company insiders constitutes insider trading. For example, if the spouse or child of a company executive trades in the company's securities based on non-public information, it could be considered insider trading, even if the executive did not provide the information directly.5. Analyst meetings: Investors may attend analyst meetings, which are meetings between company insiders and analysts where they discuss the company's financial performance and future prospects. While the information presented at these meetings is typically not considered insider information, investors should be cautious if they receive information that is not disclosed to the public.6. Social media: Company executives or employees may post information on social media platforms that could be considered insider information. Investors should be cautious when using social media as a source of information and should verify the accuracy of the information before making any investment decisions.7. Industry conferences: Industry conferences are events where companies and industry experts discuss trends and developments in a particular industry. While the information presented at these conferences is typically not considered insider information, investors should be cautious if they receive information that is not disclosed to the public.8. Personal relationships: Investors may have personal relationships with company insiders, such as friends or family members. While it is not illegal to receive information from these sources, investors should be cautious and verify the accuracy of the information before making any investment decisions
