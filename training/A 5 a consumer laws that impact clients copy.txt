A.5A. Consumer laws that impact clients including bankruptcy, credit, privacy and others1. Bankruptcy laws: Bankruptcy laws provide individuals and businesses with a legal process for eliminating or restructuring their debts. Bankruptcy laws can help clients who are struggling with debt to get a fresh start, but they also have significant consequences, such as damage to credit scores.2. Credit laws: Credit laws regulate the practices of lenders and credit reporting agencies. These laws include the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which requires credit reporting agencies to provide accurate information about consumers' credit histories, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), which prohibits discrimination in the granting of credit based on factors such as race, gender, or age.3. Privacy laws: Privacy laws regulate the collection and use of personal information by businesses and financial institutions. These laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which requires financial institutions to provide consumers with privacy notices and to implement safeguards to protect their personal information, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), which regulates telemarketing and the use of automated dialing systems.4. Consumer protection laws: Consumer protection laws regulate the practices of businesses in their interactions with consumers. These laws include the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), which prohibits abusive or harassing practices by debt collectors, and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), which requires lenders to provide borrowers with information about the costs and terms of their loans.5. Securities laws: Securities laws regulate the sale and trading of securities, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. These laws include the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to register their securities with the SEC and provide investors with accurate and complete information about the risks and benefits of investing in those securities.6. Elder financial abuse laws. Laws aim to prevent the financial exploitation of seniors and other vulnerable adults. Advisors must watch for potential abuse of their clients and know how to report suspected abuse to authorities. They need to follow applicable laws and regulations around senior clients.7. Other consumer protections. There are various other consumer laws advisors should be aware of, like truth in lending, fair debt collection, do not call rules, and more. Advisors need to understand how these laws impact their practices and ensure they are treating clients fairly and respecting their rights.* In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the client may have to liquidate certain assets to pay off creditors. This could include selling investments, real estate, vehicles, or other valuable property. The advisor would need to help the client understand how this affects their financial plans and goals.* In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the client may have to surrender certain assets to a trustee who then pays off creditors over time. Again, this could impact the client's investments, home, or other assets. The advisor would need to revisit financial plans to account for the loss or transfer of assets as part of the bankruptcy.* Even if clients keep their assets through bankruptcy, those assets may be exempt from seizure up to a certain limit. The advisor would need to understand applicable exemption limits and keep client assets within those limits. This could impact investment allocation and other decisions.* A bankruptcy will also impact a client's liabilities, like eliminating or reducing debts. The advisor must understand how this then changes the client's cash flow, expenses, and balance sheet to update their planning.Some common exemptions that clients can use to protect assets in bankruptcy include:* Homestead exemption: This exempts a client's primary residence up to a certain dollar amount or equity limit. The limits vary by state. This allows clients to keep their home during bankruptcy.* Retirement account exemptions: Retirement accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and pensions are often exempt from bankruptcy creditors. This allows clients to keep saving for retirement even during bankruptcy. There are limits on contributions during bankruptcy, however.* Vehicle exemptions: Many states allow a vehicle exemption of a certain dollar amount. This lets clients exempt a car or truck up to that limit so they can keep the vehicle during bankruptcy.* Wildcard or personal property exemptions: Some states allow blanket exemptions for a range of personal property, like money, furniture, electronics, jewelry, etc. up to a certain dollar limit. This wildcard exemption allows clients to protect miscellaneous assets during bankruptcy.* Wage exemptions: A portion of a client's wages or salary may be exempt from garnishment to pay creditors. This allows them to keep earning and using some of their income even during bankruptcy. The exact limits vary based on state and local laws as well as personal circumstances.
