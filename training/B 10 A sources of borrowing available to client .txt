B.10A. Analyze the sources of borrowing available to a client and advantages and disadvantages of eachThere are several sources of borrowing available to clients, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some commonly used sources of borrowing and their pros and cons:1. Personal loans:Personal loans are unsecured loans that are typically used for a specific purpose, such as home improvements or debt consolidation. The advantages of personal loans include fixed interest rates, fixed repayment terms, and no collateral required. However, the interest rates on personal loans can be higher than other types of loans, and approval may depend on the client's credit score and income. These can be a decent option if you know you have the means to pay it back relatively quickly. 2. Credit cards:Credit cards are a form of revolving credit that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as everyday expenses or emergency expenses. The advantages of credit cards include convenience, the ability to earn rewards or cash back, and the potential for building credit. However, credit card interest rates can be high, and carrying a balance can lead to high levels of debt.Credit cards also calculate interest typically on a daily basis on outstanding balance, called daily periodic interest. This can compound quicker than a general interest bearing loan. So for example, if you have a credit card with an 18% APR, that equates to a daily periodic rate of 0.049% (18%/365 days). Each day that is applied to outstanding balance, and gets added up at end of the month. The only advantage to credit cards is easy credit, and some rewards. However, we know that the way they offer these rewards is that most people are carrying a balance and paying higher interest. Thus the only way to get a credit card or use one for rewards is if you pay off the total and complete amount of the balance at the end of each month, no exceptions. Otherwise, you are likely losing out-points or not. 3. Home equity loans or lines of credit:Home equity loans or lines of credit are secured loans that use the borrower's home as collateral. These loans can be used for a variety of purposes, such as home improvements or debt consolidation. The advantages of home equity loans or lines of credit include lower interest rates, tax-deductible interest, and the ability to borrow larger sums of money. However, these loans pose a risk to the borrower's home if they are unable to repay the loan. Something to consider however after the real estate boom of 2020 and 2021, is that with a home equity loan or refinance, you will be assessing the property value on your home again as well as the costs that are induced by getting an approved valuation. So while you may save by using equity in your home, you very likely will increase the property tax value on your home leading to more property taxes that will be a permanent increase in the costs. Yes, local PVA associations will increase the value of your home every few years, however these are generally modest increases. 4. Auto loans:Auto loans are secured loans that are used to purchase a vehicle. The advantages of auto loans include fixed interest rates, fixed repayment terms, and the ability to borrow larger sums of money. However, auto loans can be more difficult to obtain if the borrower has a low credit score or limited income.5. Payday loans:Payday loans are short-term loans that are typically used to cover unexpected expenses or emergencies. The advantages of payday loans include quick access to cash and minimal credit requirements. However, payday loans have high interest rates and fees, and can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. These should be avoided at all costs.
