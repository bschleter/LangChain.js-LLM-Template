A.2B. Explain the disciplinary process1. Complaint: The disciplinary process begins with the receipt of a complaint filed against a CFP professional. The complaint may be filed by a client, a regulatory agency, or other parties.2. Investigation: Once a complaint is received, the CFP Board will investigate the allegations to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support disciplinary action. The CFP Board may request information and documents from the CFP professional, as well as conduct interviews with witnesses and other relevant parties.3. Notice of Intent: If the CFP Board determines that disciplinary action is warranted, it will issue a Notice of Intent to the CFP professional. The Notice of Intent outlines the allegations against the CFP professional and the disciplinary action that the CFP Board is considering.4. Settlement: Before the disciplinary hearing, the CFP professional may choose to settle the case with the CFP Board. The settlement may involve an agreement by the CFP professional to accept specific sanctions and corrective actions.5. Disciplinary Hearing: If the case is not settled, a disciplinary hearing will be held before a hearing panel. The hearing panel will hear testimony and review evidence presented by both the CFP Board and the CFP professional.6. Decision: After the hearing, the hearing panel will issue a decision. The decision may affirm, modify, or reverse the allegations against the CFP professional and the sanctions proposed by the CFP Board.7. Appeal: The CFP professional has the right to appeal the decision of the hearing panel. The appeal process involves a review by an independent appeals panel, which may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the hearing panel.8. Enforcement: Once the decision becomes final, the CFP Board will enforce the sanctions imposed against the CFP professional. The CFP professional may be required to complete additional education or training, pay a fine, or take other corrective actions as directed by the CFP Board.
