B.8B. Evaluate client financial statements using ratios and growth rates and compare them to norms. Evaluating client financial statements using ratios and growth rates can provide valuable insights into their financial position and help identify areas for improvement. Here are some general steps to follow when analyzing financial statements:1. Calculate financial ratios: Calculate key financial ratios, such as liquidity ratios (e.g. current ratio), profitability ratios (e.g. return on equity), and debt ratios (e.g. debt-to-equity ratio). These ratios can provide insights into the client's financial health and help identify areas for improvement.2. Analyze growth rates: Calculate growth rates for key financial metrics, such as revenue, net income, and cash flow. Compare these growth rates to industry norms or benchmarks to determine how the client's performance compares to others in their industry.3. Identify strengths and weaknesses: Use the financial ratios and growth rates to identify strengths and weaknesses in the client's financial position. For example, if the client has a high debt-to-equity ratio, this may indicate that they are taking on too much debt and may need to focus on reducing their debt load.4. Make recommendations: Based on the analysis, make recommendations to the client on how they can improve their financial position. For example, if the client has a low current ratio, you may recommend that they focus on building up their cash reserves to improve their liquidity.5. Monitor progress: Continuously monitor the client's financial position and track their progress over time. This will help ensure that they are making progress towards their financial goals and that any issues are addressed in a timely manner.Example Ratios-how to calculateLiquidity Ratio:The liquidity ratio is used to measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. The most commonly used liquidity ratio is the current ratio, which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities.Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current LiabilitiesFor example, if a client has $100,000 in current assets and $50,000 in current liabilities, their current ratio would be:Current Ratio = $100,000 / $50,000 = 2.0This means that the client has $2.00 in current assets for every $1.00 in current liabilities, which indicates that they have a strong ability to meet their short-term obligations.Debt Ratio:The debt ratio is used to measure a company's leverage or its ability to pay off its long-term debt. The debt ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by total assets.Debt Ratio = Total Debt / Total AssetsFor example, if a client has $200,000 in total debt and $500,000 in total assets, their debt ratio would be:Debt Ratio = $200,000 / $500,000 = 0.4Growth Rates basic example:To calculate the growth rates for the client's financial plan, we can use the following formula:Growth Rate = [(Current Year Value / Previous Year Value) - 1] x 100For example, to calculate the growth rate for the client's revenue from Year 1 to Year 2, we would use the following formula:Revenue Growth Rate (Year 1 to Year 2) = [(110,000 / 100,000) - 1] x 100 = 10%
